So I spent a few hours on Friday bringing up a .TEXT based weblog site for my employer, Interlink Group. We have a number of really smart guys there and I've been trying to get them to blog for a while. Hopefully it'll work out. At first glace, I really like the look of .TEXT. I particularly like the Articles bit. From looking at the code (and talking to The .NET Guy) it sounds like the templates aren't separated from the code well enough, but I don't know how much I really care about that. We'll see... maybe I'll convert from dasBlog to .TEXT one of these days.
