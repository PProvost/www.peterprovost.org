Man... got a bit of a hangover this morning... Ugh.

When I arrived at the park with my coworkers, I immediately ran into the [blogger meeting](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=cdbdd4dc-b643-4882-b756-8ff7208be164) near the front. Too many tech bloggers to list here... needless to say, Scoble, Werner and Canter were the loudest.

The blogger group wandered around from beer station to beer station for an hour or two before splitting up. I ended up near the back hanging out with [Werner Vogle](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/), Jamie Cansdale and a few others. I really enjoyed getting to know Werner. He is a research professor with Cornell. Very cool guy. If you deal with anything in distributed computing, you should certainly be reading [his blog](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/).

Later in the evening Harry Pierson (aka [DevHawk](http://www.devhawk.net/)) came by and drank with us. I talked to too many bloggers to remember them all, so I won't try anymore.

UPDATE: Werner has [posted some photos from the party](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000316.html).
