I haven't posted a Haiku in a while. 

_Test, Code, Refactor...  
Repeat until you are done.  
Is it that easy?_

_Some say it isn't.  
That you can't skip the design.  
__They can't stop asking..._

_"How can it be that  
Emergent design will work?  
Where's the architect?"_

_Architects are there.  
Writing tests and writing code.  
__Over and over._

_But they let the code  
Tell them what the design is.  
They just listen well._
