No I'm not talking about politics, per se. I'm talking about how the American media is so... well...&nbsp_place_holder;American-focused.

22,000 people dead (at last count this morning) from the 9.0 earthquake in Indonesia and CNN makes sure to point out how few Americans were involved. I understand that Americans want to know about Americans, but don't forget about the millions of Southeast Asian folks who live and work here every day. Don't discount their losses just because they aren't of western-european descent.

Rather than go into a long diatribe about it, I'll just point you to [Scott Hanselman's post on the subject](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=484c3d5f-9738-4e1f-b9b4-050474f79f7d).
