> Need a disposable email address so you can sign up for some web site, quick? You've already got one, at Paul Tyma's clever [Mailinator](http://www.mailinator.com/). ?Just send an email to any address @mailinator.com. Your email address already exists. Get your email sent here, THEN come check mailinator. Your mail will be waiting.? More proof that great UI design is done by taking away, not adding things.
