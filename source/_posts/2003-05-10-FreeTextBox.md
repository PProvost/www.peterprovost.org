[FreeTextBox ](http://www.revjon.com/ftb/)is:

> _A free ASP.NET control written in C# implimenting MSHTML in Internet Explorer. It can be validated using standard ASP.NET validators and has many options for customization. _

Where was this when I needed it 2 months ago? My company bought a professional license for [RichTextBox](http://www.richtextbox.com), which is a nice control, but [FTB ](http://www.revjon.com/ftb/)is free and comes with source code. Nice!
