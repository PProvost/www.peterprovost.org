Topic: Continous Integration 

Most people have heard of continuous integration, but most haven't  
actually used it in production. During this meeting we will talk about  
the issues surrounding continuous integration. 

  * What are the benefits?
  * What are the drawbacks?
  * Is it worth it?
  * What tools are available to help out?

We plan to demo a running [CruiseControl.NET](http://www.continuousintegration.net/) build server, so come on out  
and see what we're talking about. 

Refreshments will be provided. 

We look forward to seeing you there.
