Ha ha ha... this is funny, except for those poor souls who got the message!

> Staff at Britain's biggest personal injury claims firm, The Accident Group, were told they had been sacked by an early hours text message when the company went out of business yesterday, leaving 2,500 people jobless. 

What's next? Fired by Instant Messenger?
