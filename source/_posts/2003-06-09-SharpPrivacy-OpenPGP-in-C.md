I while ago I posted about wanting a native implementation of PGP for .NET. Well, it looks like someone did it. It is still in beta, but looks good so far. It is open-source, so download and go crazy reading crypto code! 

A [tutorial has been posted to CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/sharpprivacy.asp) that shows you how to use it.
