OK, I'll admit I've been thinking about copying [Mike Gunderloy](http://www.larkware.com/)'s [posting style](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind220.html) for a long time now... I finally decided today to give it a shot. Here's how this will work:

  1. Links and such will be collected into one post instead of many small posts 
  2. Original content or things that require more comment by me will get full posts of their own

That said, here is the Nov 7 2003 edition of Geek Notes:

  * [ProFont](http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/) -&nbsp_place_holder;A very small monospace programming font. A little small for my 1600x1200 desktop though, so I'll probably stick with Lucida Console 11pt. &nbsp_place_holder;[via [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/11/06.html)] 
  * [Google Desk Bar](http://toolbar.google.com/deskbar/) - Add google searching to your task bar. Installed. 
  * [Virtual PC 2004 RTM Next Week](http://bink.nu/DesktopModules/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=414) - Can't wait for this... I'm still running the PDC Beta [via [Sam Gentile's Blog](http://samgentile.com/blog/posts/10574.aspx)] 
  * [Rob Relyea is blogging](http://longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/) - Rob is the Program Manager for Avalon. Subscribed. 
  * [Church Sign Generator](http://www.aboyandhiscomputer.com/churchsigngenerator/) - This is hilarious. As soon as I think of something funny, I'll post one. [via [John Bristowe's Weblog](http://www.bristowe.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=086b9915-14cd-4e9e-8ca8-80710c74abb3)]

PS. I know there are other pages and such out there called Geek Notes. I don't care. This is my Geek Notes. :)
