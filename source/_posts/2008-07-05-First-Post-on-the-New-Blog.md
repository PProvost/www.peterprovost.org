It looks like there was a minor hiccup on the 301 redirector, but I got that taken care of quickly this morning. Hopefully it didn't mess up too many people.

Also got the Feedburner feed directed onto the new RSS endpoint, so that should be good to.

Hopefully there aren't any other issues and it just keeps working.
