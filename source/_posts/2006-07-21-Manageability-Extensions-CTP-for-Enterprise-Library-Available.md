The patterns & practices team has released the Manageability Extensions for Enterprise Library January 2006. Please download this extension&nbsp_place_holder;from the [Downloads page on the Enterprise Library Community Site](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327). 

Manageability extensions for Enterprise Library Jan 2006 allows you to use Group Policy to update application configuration information, and to publish a running applications configuration to WMI, so that it can be consumed by any WMI-aware management application. The manageability extensions can be used with any application that makes use of Enterprise Library v 2.0, and does not require any recoding of the application itself. 

Please feel free to discuss this CTP in the [Manageability Extensions Message Board](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/messageboard/home.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327&mbid=f4e70832-7e17-4e1b-87de-fbc8fe7b22cb).&nbsp_place_holder;All feedback is appreciated.
