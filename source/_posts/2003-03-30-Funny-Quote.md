> _"You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, and Germany doesn't want to go to war." From Terry Farrell in a newsgroup I frequent. [_[_The Scobleizer Weblog_](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/)_]_
