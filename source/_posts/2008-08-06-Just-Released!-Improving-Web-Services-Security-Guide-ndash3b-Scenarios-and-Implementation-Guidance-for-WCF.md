My former team has released a new guide that is getting rave reviews from people called "Improving Web Services Security: Scenarios and Implementation Guidance for WCF". 

Some juicy quotes from reviewers:

  * " I am new to WCF programming....The guide is very good, very useful and definitely saving us time. It has become the central document from which we are developing. "
  * ".... you really did a great job! I think that every WCF developer should keep your book as day by day reference..."
  * "Very cool and extremely useful.... I can't say enough good things about this ... it's an amazing work. ...."
  * "Awesome, phreaking, colossal... the content is unique - there is no match of it...Very timely just as WCF becomes mainstream with my customers. ... It is serious booster with real world projects..."
