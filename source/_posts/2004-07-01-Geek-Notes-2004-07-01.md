I'm off to see Shrek 2 with my wife and daughter in a couple of minutes. Should be fun. We all loved the first movie, especially the kid. This will be our first attempt to take her to a movie, so we are fully expecting that we will have to bail out after an hour. We'll see.

  * [The Political Compass Test](http://www.politicalcompass.org/)&nbsp_place_holder;- I got -2.44 and -2.67, so I guess I'm fairly centrist on their model.
