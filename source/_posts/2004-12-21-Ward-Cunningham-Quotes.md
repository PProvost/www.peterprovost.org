One of the coolest things about working at _[patterns & practices](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/default.mspx)_, is getting to bump into [Ward Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) (inventor of CRC cards, wiki and much of the ideas and thinking behind Extreme Programming). Last month I went to see Ward give a talk over at [MS Research](http://research.microsoft.com/). During the presentation I tried to type into my phone many of the funny and insightful things he shared with the group. Here are some of my favorites.

**Talking about software development methodology **

> "I don't claim to be a methodologist, but I act like one only because I do methodology to protect myself from crazy methodologists."

**Talking about the lack of data on pair programming effectiveness **

> "When a manager asks for hard data, that's usually just his way of saying no."

**Talking about code smells **

> "There is a programming smell here which is kind of like the smell in your refrigerator, you know. There's a sign that there's something wrong, but you can't quite put your finger on it. But you know if you leave it there, its only going to get worse."

**Talking about testing, TDD, etc **

> "What I'm really doing is I'm trying to preserve the right for a programmer to think while he's typing. If you feel that it's not going well, you can stop and say 'What did I get wrong? Let me correct it.'"
