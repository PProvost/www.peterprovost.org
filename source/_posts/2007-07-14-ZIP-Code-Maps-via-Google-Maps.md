Today Emily and were looking for something by zip code and were very frustrated that we couldn't find any good online ZIP code maps that didn't cost money. Seems insane... right?

How happy I was when I discovered this site: [http://maps.huge.info/zip.htm](http://maps.huge.info/zip.htm)

They have done yet another Google Maps hack, this time overlaying the ZIP database information. Woot!
