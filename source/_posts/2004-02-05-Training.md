So I'm sitting here trying to figure out how all the top training guys (Don Box,├é Chris Sells,├é John Lam,├é Craig Andera, Keith Brown, etc.) ever find time to blog or write. Sure Don and Chris aren't doing├é much of the training thing anymore, but I still don't know how they ever found time. 

In the past few weeks I have been doing├é a lot of training for the├é Microsoft├é Rocky Mountain District office. Some of it was customized curriculum,├é that I had to write, and some of it was official MOC material. But I am not the kind of person who can step into a room full of people unprepared, so each night I spent a fair amount of time getting ready. You know, reviewing my slides, practicing the demos, confirming that the labs work, etc. 

But for a full day's training, it takes at least 3 or 4 hours to prepare, even when you already have the materials. So the question remains, how the heck did they ever find time to blog, do the newsgroups, write articles... not to mention write books? 

I am in awe of them. 

PS. I'll try to get a Geek Notes issue out soon...
