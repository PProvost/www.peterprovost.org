Haha... I love the Internet sometimes. I was sitting here in my office listening to the Tool song Jambi, tapping my foot along, counting the beats on a background thread as I am wont to do...

"Hmm... this is in 9/4 time signature. COOL!"

You see, I've always loved finding songs that have unusual time signatures. One quick search later and I found this little page over on Answers.com:

[List of musical works in unusual time signatures](http://www.answers.com/topic/list-of-musical-works-in-unusual-time-signatures)

Cool. I'm gonna have to dig through my music for some of those.
