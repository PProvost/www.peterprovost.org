Has anyone given any thought to posting comments from within an aggregator? I'm thinking this would require a few things... unless I'm missing something. Primarily, we would need to add a field in the RSS feed indicating how and where to post comments. I can imagine that the method could be something like HTTP POST, SOAP, etc. Then we would need to get the aggregators to support it. Given the work that people have been doing in creating extension interfaces this shouldn't be too hard.

Anyone started something like this already?
