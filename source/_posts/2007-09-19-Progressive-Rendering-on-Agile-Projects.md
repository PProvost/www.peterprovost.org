There was another discussion on the internal agile discussion list that I thought was worth talking about here.

The question was, "How much detail should work items in your product backlog have?"

[Eric Gunnerson](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/)&nbsp_place_holder;replied:

> It depends on where it is in the backlog. 
> 
> Items that are just entered and/or are quite a ways out can be fairly general. 
> 
> Items that are near that top have to have sufficient detail for the team to be able to generate sprint items from them. 
> 
> To start, I think it├óΓé¼Γäós more important to capture absolutely everything, and then work at doing the refinement as you need it. 

And I followed up with this: 

> +1 from me on Eric├óΓé¼Γäós description. 
> 
> Basically when something is ├óΓé¼┼ôway down the plan├óΓé¼┬¥, it need be nothing more than a reminder to the person who added it to the backlog. A title and perhaps a description. If they actually have some idea of acceptance criteria then put that too, but it certainly isn├óΓé¼Γäót required. A ├óΓé¼┼ôT-Shirt size├óΓé¼┬¥ doesn├óΓé¼Γäót hurt if your team uses such things. 
> 
> As the item floats up the stack, you need to add more detail to it. Before it can get into a Release Plan (I├óΓé¼Γäóm more of an XP-er than a Scrummie), it needs more detail. It may need to get broken down. You will need to think about where it fits in your skeleton architecture. You want to have a sense of what the design might look like. 
> 
> For it to get through the iteration plan, it needs more information. Better estimating. Clearer acceptance criteria. Etc. 
> 
> I like to call this ├óΓé¼┼ôProgressive Rendering├óΓé¼┬¥. Everything in agile is about progressively discovering more detail as the detail is needed. It is about doing a thing at the last responsible moment.

At least that's how I like to think of it. :)
