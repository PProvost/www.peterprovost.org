I was driving through downtown Denver today and saw a guy standing at the red light. I was paying close attention, but at first glance it looked like he was standing with a luggage trolley. Then when he got the pedestrian crossing signal, he leaned forward and took off. It wasn't a luggage trolley, it was a [Segway](http://www.segway.com/)! Cool.
