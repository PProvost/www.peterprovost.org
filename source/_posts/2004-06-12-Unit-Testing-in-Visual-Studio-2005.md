I want to start a blog petition. I want everyone who agrees with me to blog the following sentence:

> **Unit Testing support should be included with all versions of Visual Studio 2005 and not just with Team System.**

Please link or trackback to this post so I can keep track of how well this works.

Thanks

[UPDATE: I added [this](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/13/1410.aspx) for those who don't know what I'm talking about.]

[UPDATE2: I followed up to some of the opposing posts with [this](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/14/1472.aspx).]

[UPDATE3: I suppose&nbsp_place_holder;I should mention that [TestDriven.NET](http://www.testdriven.net/) (nee NUnitAddin)&nbsp_place_holder;supports all versions of .NET (except maybe the Express versions of 2005, but that isn't 100% yet.]
