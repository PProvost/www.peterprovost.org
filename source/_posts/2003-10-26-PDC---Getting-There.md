Well, I'm finally here in LA...

I left Denver in the 8PM flight to LA. No big surprises there. Threw the Matrix in the DVD player, popped on my Bose noise-cancelling headphones and settled in for a flick. Laptop battery didn't die on me and I got about 2/3 of the way through before they made me shutdown.

As we were approaching LA, we were treated to an amazing view of the fires burning just outside the city. I wish I carried a camera phone so I could've taken a pic. It was a long line of flame that started right under the plane and extended out as far as I could see. I have no idea how much farther it went in the other direction. I was really surprised how close it was to the city. There were highways and streets right next to the fire. Very cool to see, but sad for the people affected.

I decided to save a couple of bucks and took a Super Shuttle into my hotel. At the curb I told the lady, "Park Hyatt". She told me to get on the downtown shuttle, which arrived within 5 minutes. (Those of you who know LA are probably giggling already.)

After two dropoffs downtown, the driver runs through the list of hotels he is going to hit next. "And the Park Hyatt..?" I ask.

"WHAT?" responds the driver.

It turns out that the Park Hyatt is on the west side and NOT downtown. So my driver had to drive me all the way out to my hotel after dropping off everyone else. About 45 minutes later than expected, I finally arrived at my hotel. (Along the way I met a bunch of other PDC'ers... one of them figured out that his hotel was the Holiday Inn Downtown Long Beach, not the Holiday Inn Downtown LA. Oops.)

There is a wedding or something going on in the hotel as I stagger up to the registration desk. As the clerk is looking up my room, I tell him my whole story. It isn't really that big a deal, I know, but either he took it to heart or I got lucky.

"We upgraded your room for free," he says.

And boy did they! I've got a big bedroom, a living room, 2 TVs, highspeed internet. The works!

Too bad it looks like I'll spend 12 hours a day at the convention center. :)

Tomorrow I'll be attending Chris Sells' pre-con session .NET - The Smart Client Perspective. I'm really looking forward to this session. Chris is a good speaker and I have a lot of respect for what he has to say. Not to mention, this is technology that I can actually use NOW, unlike Whidbey, Yukon, Indigo, Avalon, etc.

Hopefully I'll post from the session tomorrow morning. I'm going to run downstairs and pound a beer before bed.
