I'm at the aiport, working on a nasty Win32 DLL written in C, waiting for my flight back to Denver. Looks like I've fallen a bit behind on the Geek Notes, so I've got my work cut out for me.

  * [MSDN TV: Building Your First Business Process](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040520biztalksw/manifest.xml) - Watch Scott Woodgate show how easy it is to build a business process using Visual Studio .NET and BizTalk Server 2004, expose that business process as a Web service, and then consume the business process inside InfoPath - all within 20 minutes.
  * [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=fb7b3dcd-d4c1-4943-9c74-d8df57ef19d7) - I've been threatening to create a Dvorak-style keyboard mapping but instead of using English to figure out character usage ratios, I want to use C/C++/C# character usage. Maybe I'll have time some day... probably not.
  * [TMC Introduces SOA Blueprints](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=25974) - Sounds like an interesting idea, create a set of best-practices and open-specifications for multi-platform SOA development.
  * [NUnitAddin Has&nbsp_place_holder;Gone Green!](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2004/05/21/137589.aspx) - Jamie has finally released a version of my favorite VS.NET addin that now has a GUI and nice little green and red dots in a tree. Must have.
  * [ObjectSpaces Isn't Going to Ship](http://weblogs.asp.net/jezell/archive/2004/05/22/139372.aspx) - Not all that surprising. Anybody remember when this product was actually annouced? Back in .NET 1.0. We'll see if it ever ships.
  * [New FileDisassembler for Reflector 4.0](http://www.denisbauer.com/weblog/PermaLink,guid,e1f697cc-bce6-4cdc-a855-b1da200113c8.aspx) - Wow. It now makes all the other bits that you need to really be able to compile the code. Very cool.
