1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?

> I prefer science fiction followed up with technical or science non-fiction.

2. What is your favorite novel?

> [Dune](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/044100590X/peterprovosto-20). Well... the entire original Dune Series. Or maybe [Ender's Game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312932081/peterprovosto-20). Hard to decide.

3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)

> Nope. I only just started the whole Haiku thing and I don't have much experience with poetry.

4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?

> The Koran.

5. What are you currently reading?

> [Crypotnomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380973464/peterprovosto-20) by Neil Stephenson.
