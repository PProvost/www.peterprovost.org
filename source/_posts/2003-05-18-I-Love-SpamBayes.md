OK, I'm hooked.&nbsp_place_holder;For the last six months or so, I was using a product that I thought was free: [Cloudmark SpamNet](http://www.cloudmark.com/products/spamnet/). It was a good product, but when they decided to go to a subscription based commercial product, I bailed. Conceptually it was a nice product, basically the Napster concept for spam blocking, but I didn't want to be hijacked into paying for it year after year.

Well, as I reported a few weeks ago, I received many recommendations for the [SpamBayes Outlook Addin](http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/spambayes/). I've been running it for a couple of weeks now and I have to say how impressed I am. In the past 32 hours, it caught 150 confirmed spam messages and 9 possible spam messages. It missed only 6 spam messages that I had to remove from my Inbox myself. This is at least as good as SpamNet, probably better.

Very cool. I just wish it has nice graphs like some others I've seen.
