Luke was thinking about getting a TiVo... honestly at this point I can't believe everyone doesn have one... when he discovered that his cable company (Time Warner Cable) is about to start offering a DVR built right into their digital cable box. When and if Comcast does this, I'm pretty sure I'll switch. At first glance it has at least two significant advantages over TiVo:

  * Picture in Picture without a special TV
  * Record one channel while watching another

And it is only $7 more that their regular digital cable. Not bad. And no equipment to buy. I'm sold.
