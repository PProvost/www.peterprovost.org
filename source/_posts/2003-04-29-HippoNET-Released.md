Wow. This looks nice...

> _**Hippo.NET** is a tool for streamlining the build process of .NET projects in a **team envirionment**. It provides continuous integration by monitoring the shared **Visual SourceSafe** database and starting the build process when changes are detected. An important design goal is to provide a nice and easy-to-use user interface, to monitor builds and trigger the build process when needed. _

I was thinking about building something like this on top of [NAnt](http://nant.sourceforge.net/), but now I don't have to.
