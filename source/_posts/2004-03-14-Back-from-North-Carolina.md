We just got home from a wonderful vacation in the mountains of North Carolina. My father and his wife live in Asheville and we took our daughter Hadley out there to spend time with "Grammy and Bompie". It was a blast. Hadley got to spend some quality time with her grandparents on my side and with some of her cousins as well. It was a lot of fun watching those three kids chase each other for the past four days. 

Then came today. 

The flight out on Wednesday was a breeze. Hadley is two, so we were a bit concerned, but it turned out well. No tantrums, no screaming... nothing bad at all. 

So that is why we were caught so unprepared this afternoon. She started off this morning a bit crabby, but she is that age, so we didn't think much of it. She was find on the drive to the airport. She was even fine in the airport. But as soon as we got on the plane, her head spun around like the girl in The Exorcist and we were stuck in that aluminum tube with her for 3 1/2 hours. And so were all the other passengers. (Actually she was only bad for 30 minutes at the beginning and an hour at the end... but that 1 1/2 hours felt like 3 1/2.) 

We never thought we would be "those parents" with "that kid" but there we were. Back when I was a spectator I would wonder to myself, "Isn't there something the parents can do to make that kid shut up?" 

Today I learned the answer and it is a resounding "no". When a two year old throws an hour long tantrum on an airplane there really isn't anything you can do. 

Needless to say we are reconsidering whether we want to do this again in another month or so... we'll see.
