The .NET Guy [writes](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/002789.shtml): 

> _I find when I'm reading things that the exceptionally long entries are the ones I'm most likely to skip (and I'm pretty sure I'm reading about half as much as my wife). It's an unfortunately&nbsp_place_holder;necessary time savings device.&nbsp_place_holder;I've been trying to trim down the length of my posts to make them more appealing to the rushed reader. Anybody else experiencing this? [_[_The .NET Guy_](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/)_]_

Interesting. I find that the short ones often don't get my interest. The long ones give me something to think about.
