Wahoo! The most recent release of [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/windows.html) (version 0.7) works with Outlook 2003. Oh how I have missed thee.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the best, FREE spam filter around for Outlook. (It doesn't work with Outlook Express.) It uses Bayesian Filtering and once you train it with couple hundred messages it rarely misses and I've never had it get a false positive. SpamBayes absolutely rocks!
