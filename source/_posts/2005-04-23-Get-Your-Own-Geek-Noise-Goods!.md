[![GeekNoisePinkTee](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/GeekNoisePinkTee_thumb.jpg)](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/GeekNoisePinkTee.JPG)Effective today, I've opened the [Geek Noise Store](http://www.cafepress.com/geeknoise) where you can buy T-Shirts and other crap with my logo on it. It helps me pay for this site and you get to have my cool logo on your body. ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile3.gif)

I don't actually expect anyone to buy any of this crap--except maybe my wife--but it is kinda fun. And setting one up at CafePress.com is easy and free, so why not?)
