Wow. Lots of cool ASP.NET controls today. [Robert McClaws](http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/) [posted yesterday](http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/posts/23093.aspx) asking for a calendar control (a la Outlook week/month view) and today [he found one](http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/posts/23220.aspx).

It is by a company called Media Chase and is called [Calendar.NET](http://center.mediachase.com/Default.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=2). Nice.

PS. Yes, I know, it probably produces tons of HTML.
