I just finished a solution spike for an XSLT tranformation pipeline that lets you chain a series of XSLT&nbsp_place_holder;transforms together. I'm playing around with using it in a content manegement framework. If I ever go with it and break it out of my spike, I'll post it here. If anyone wants a copy sooner than that, [email me](mailto:peter@provost.org). If anyone knows of another one out there somewhere, please let me know.
