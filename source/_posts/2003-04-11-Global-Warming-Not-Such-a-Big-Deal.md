I'm not a climatologist or anything like that, but I've been saying for quite&nbsp_place_holder;a while that all of the hype about global warming was just that... hype.

Well now it looks like [some scientists are starting to speak up](http://www.zianet.com/wblase/endtimes/gwarming.htm) about this. I don't doubt that all the crap we pump into the air isn't helping stabilize things. It is my opinion that the planet tends toward a more periodic, cyclical kind of being over time. It only makes sense therefore that we will have periods of warm followed by periods of cool... wet followed by dry... etc.

UPDATE 2004-11-10: It appears the original link from this blog posting disappeared during one of my blog engine migrations. I've relinked it to (hopefully) the original location.
