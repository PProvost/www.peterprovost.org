For anyone with teams or managers wondering about Test-First Development or TDD techniques, my friends at Pluralsight are giving a free course for the next 24-hours. TDD expert David Starr and Scott Allen will take you through the history, background and techniques. He also includes data in support of test-first practices in case you're in a situation where you're getting management pushback.
