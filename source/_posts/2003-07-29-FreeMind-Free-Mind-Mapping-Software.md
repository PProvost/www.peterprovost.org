But the presentation and editing is so powerful and intuitive that it pretty much eliminates any friction involved in _restructuring_ your XML document. You also have the ability to link to external URL's and external files.

Very cool. I just finished installing it and immediately started using it to help me organize my thoughts for a proposal I have to do today. I've never used mind mapping before, so this is all new to me, but I've seen people do it so I'm not totally in the dark.

UPDATE: After writing this post, I realized that a branching mind-map is a beautiful visual representation of the XML InfoSet. I wonder why no one has written an XML editor with this UI?
