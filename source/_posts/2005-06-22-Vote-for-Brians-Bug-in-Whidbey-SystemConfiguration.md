My good friend Brian Button has found an interesting bug in Whidbey's configuration system. Go [read his post](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/archive/2005/06/11/3689.aspx), then if you agree that this is wrong, please [vote for the bug](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/ProductFeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=2e8b3699-0288-4756-bba6-227bce82b9e1).

Thanks for helping make the platform better!
