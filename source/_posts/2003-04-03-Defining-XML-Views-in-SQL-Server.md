If you don't know what XML Views are, you certainly should read [this article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsqlmag02/html/DefiningXMLViews.asp). It is a nice overview of what they are and how you start with an XSL schema and turn it into an XML View.

When you are done with that one, you might want to check out [this article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsqlmag03/html/IDAttributesinXMLViews.asp) about using ID, IDREF and IDREFS attributes to create primary keys and foreign key relationships. Good stuff from SQL Server Magazine via MSDN.
