I hope one of my five readers knows the answer to this question...

In Outlook 2003, you can use **File | Open | Other User's Folder** to open someone else's Inbox. So far this is just like previous versions of Outlook.

But what about if you want to view the email in a subfolder? OL2003 doesn't open the entire folder tree for the user. It just opens the Inbox folder. How can I get access to the tree? Is this a bug? Please help.

Email me or post a comment if you know the answer. Thanks!
