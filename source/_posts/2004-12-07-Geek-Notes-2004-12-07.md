I am just not satisfied with the state of RSS readers. I started with an old web based one, then [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/), then [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/), then [RSSBandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/), then [BlogLines](http://www.bloglines.com/), back to [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/) and now I've switched to [JetBrains Omea](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea_reader/). So far so good, but it is still missing a few things that I would like. (Until Jan 1 2005, you can get a free perpetual license for Omea, so go get one now. Even if you aren't going to switch, you may want to someday. ![](file:///C:/Program%20Files/BlogJet/Data/Smiles/smile1.gif))

  * [Changing the Location of the ASP.NET Validation Scripts](http://weblogs.asp.net/cnagel/archive/2004/11/30/272225.aspx) - Sometimes you want to change where the scripts are located, instead of using the defaul. Christian Nagel found the web.config setting for this.
  * [List of 7-11s in Hawaii](http://broken.typepad.com/b/2004/12/711_list_of_haw.html) - Ha ha ha ha according to the store website, the closest one is in LA!
  * [Programming Contest at EggHeadCafe](http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/contest.asp) - Design and implement a Swedish Chef translator. Winners get $50. Yea! [via [Eric Gunnerson](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/12/01/273087.aspx)]
  * [PDF Speedup](http://www.acropdf.com/products.html) - I blogged about removing some of the plug-ins to improve Acrobat Reader's startup time, but now someone has made a tool to do it for you. Recommeded!

  * [Consolicious Defined](http://weblogs.ilg.com/brumfieldb/archive/2004/12/02/554.aspx) - I love this word. Since joining P&P I have returned to my console loving ways that started back in my DOS and UNIX roots.
  * [Common Larceny](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jrm/download.html) - No, I'm not talking about crime. I'm talking about an implementation of the Scheme programming language for .NET. That's all well and good, but what I really want is Ruby for .NET. [via [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/12/02/274150.aspx)]
