I wish I knew of someone in the Denver area who has [one of these](http://www.fingerworks.com/igesture.html). I've always thought that a chord-based input device (where combining more than one key or gesture creates a new meaning) were going to happen. I've dabbled with chord-based editor addins and such, but this might just be what I was looking for.

If you've got one and live in Denver, [email me](mailto:peter@provost.org). I'd love to see it.
