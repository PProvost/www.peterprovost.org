On Friday we released the [October 2005 CTP of the Composite UI Application Block](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/news/newsitem.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c&newsId=0ccd61cc-3f70-409f-ab65-d2abf1906609) to the [GDN Community Site](http://codegallery.gotdotnet.com/cab). Go get the bits from the [Download Page](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c) and let us know what you think. 

We've changed a number of things based on customer feedback from the June drop and we really think it is better. This version is based on .NET 2.0 RC (aka version 2.0.50727.26), so make sure you have the right framework bits installed before trying to build it. (You can get information about [downloading the Release Candidate from MSDN](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/get/).) 

Finally, expect a number of posts from me and [Brad](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy) (and others I'm sure) about the cool new stuff in there, especially the changes since the June release and details on the Object Builder dependency injection framework. 

Enjoy!
