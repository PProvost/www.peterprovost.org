The p&p Client Team is pleased to announce the CTP release of the Smart Client Baseline Architecture Toolkit. 

Check out [the downloads section](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=941d2228-3bb5-42fd-8004-c08595821170) in the [SC-BAT gotdotnet codegallery site](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/scbat). The new release includes several bug fixes, complete documentation (including How Tos, architecture descriptions, etc), the first Reference Implementation (Appraiser Workbench) and Guidance Packages to automate common developer tasks. 

We strongly suggest you should take a look at the "Getting Started" document included in the distribution that explains the recommended way of exploring this guidance offering.  
We would like to take the opportunity to thank this community for the support and feedback provided during the development of this deliverable. Please continue to help us!
