Busy busy... had an unexpected cube move on Friday afternoon, then forgot to bring my power adapter home, so I couldn't post this until this morning. Oops. 

  * [Dating Design Patterns](http://datingdesignpatterns.com/index.html) - This is absolutely hilarious. I thought it was a joke, but it is actually listed at Soft Pro Books! 
  * [BlogShares is Gone](http://boingboing.net/2003_12_01_archive.html#107051135051919190) - Seyed Razavi has closed down BlogShares. He says, "deliverying a fun, useful service for the BlogShares community requires an active operator and developer... I've been neither for the past couple of months." 
  * [HOW TO: Secure Applications That Are Build on the .NET Framework](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;818014) - A new article on MSKB. 
  * [Photoshop was Invented for StarWars](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/main_news.cfm?NewsID=7428) - This is an interesting historical note. Russel Preston Brown, Adobe employee #38 says, "Photoshop is here today because of that movie." [via [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2003_12_01_archive.html#107054113349288852)]
