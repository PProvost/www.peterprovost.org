Someone pointed out today that I hadn't been blogging lately (guilty as charged) and that I hadn't blogged anything at all about recent changes in my work life. 

A year ago, various personal and family issues led me to make a promise to my wife that I would move her back to Denver. We've enjoyed Seattle a lot, but with her Lupus and other things, she needed to be closer to her family. This led me to start looking around for opportunities that would let me get back to Denver. 

Long story short, I have moved on from P&P and am now working as a Program Manager on the Visual Studio Team System Architect Edition product. This role will allow me to live in Denver and work remotely most of the time. I still plan to be back in the Redmond area every month or two, though. 

We're doing some really exciting stuff on the VSTS-AE product at the moment that I'm really looking forward to sharing with you all soon, so please stay tuned. I think I feel my blogging genes firing up again. :)
