A few minutes ago I helped Brad Wilson (aka The .NET Guy and fellow _patterns & practices_ developer) move his blog over from his old UNIX MT blog site and onto agileprogrammer.com with me and Brian Button.

Brad wrote a very cool Ruby script do the import that I'm hoping he'll post to his blog. 200-ish lines of code to do the whole job from MT/RSS into MetaWeblogAPI and my .TEXT derived blog engine. Ruby is such a great language for this kind of thing.

Please welcome Brad to AgileProgrammer.com. You can read his new blog at [http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy)
