I love it when one of our communities starts taking on a life of its own as has the [Composite User Interface Application Block (aka CAB) community](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c). 

Now a few of them have gone even further and started [a site on GotDotNet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=13b0773f-3e75-47da-9a2a-f32a59050bef) dedicated to integrating CAB and the Developer Express control suite. 

Congrats guys!
