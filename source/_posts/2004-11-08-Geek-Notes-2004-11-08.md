[Atticus Finch](http://www.provost.org/atticus-finch.asp), our family's chocolate labrador, is finally home.&nbsp_place_holder;We left him behind in Denver when we moved out here, but Saturday morning Emily's dad came for a visit and brought him along. We're glad to have him home and he is glad to be back with us. I completely forget how big he is and how annoying he can be... but I'm still glad he's here.
