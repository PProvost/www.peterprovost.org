Well, it is official. Eben and I are parting ways. Effective end of day, June 30 I am leaving Bespoke Technologies. Eben will continue on running Bespoke and I wish him nothing but the best.├é I will still be doing some contract work for Bespoke for the next week or so, but if any of my readers know of a good home for someone with my skills, please let me know
