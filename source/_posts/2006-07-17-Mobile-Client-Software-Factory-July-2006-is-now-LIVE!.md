The great team over on [Mobile Client just released their software factory to MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/MobileClientFactory). In addition to the guidance packages and reference implementations, one thing you should certainly look at if you do mobile work is the "Orientation Aware Control" (OAC). 

That alone is worth the download. ![](/Files/smile1.gif)

Congratulations to the team!
