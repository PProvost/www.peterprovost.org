Yesterday at [Seattle Code Camp](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/), I did four presentations, two with [Brad Wilson](http://agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy) and two by myself. During our talks, we promised to share the slides and code from our demos, so here you go. 

  * Monad - The New Microsoft Command Shell 
    * [Powerpoint](/Files/CodeCampSeattle2005/Monad%20-%20The%20New%20Microsoft%20Command%20Shell.ppt)&nbsp_place_holder;(106 KB)
  * Dependency Injection - What, Why and How 
    * [Powerpoint](/Files/CodeCampSeattle2005/Dependency%20Injection.ppt)&nbsp_place_holder;(58 KB)
    * Sorry, but the code from this one isn't available.
  * TDD GUI Using MVP (and the pair programming game) 
    * [Powerpoint](/Files/CodeCampSeattle2005/TDDing%20GUIs%20using%20MVP.ppt)&nbsp_place_holder;(60 KB)
    * [Demo Source](/Files/CodeCampSeattle2005/tdd-source.zip) (16KB ZIP)
  * Composite User Interface Application Block 
    * [Powerpoint](/Files/CodeCampSeattle2005/Composite%20UI%20Application%20Block.ppt)&nbsp_place_holder;(1.5 MB)
    * [Demo Source](/Files/CodeCampSeattle2005/cab_demo.zip) (40 KB ZIP)

I have lots of thank-yous that I want to share. Many thanks to the attendees. The talks were a lot of fun and I love it when the attendees involve themselves and ask lots of questions. Thanks to [Ed Jezierski](http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez/) for providing some of the slides I used in the CAB talk and thanks to [Adam Barr](http://www.proudlyserving.com/) for sharing his Monad slides with me. Thanks to [Chris Kinsman](http://www.vergentsoftware.com/blogs/ckinsman/) and [Jason Mauer](http://www.jasonmauer.com/) for putting on a great event. Finally thanks again to Brad for being a great co-presenter.
