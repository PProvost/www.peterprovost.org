I just noticed that Scott Hanselman used the word "Reflectoring" in [this post about XmlSerializer and caching](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=37892be7-18ee-4fe9-a9f1-3e4420503c43). 

That is the first time I noticed the word being used. I dig it. Was Scott the first to coin the term?
