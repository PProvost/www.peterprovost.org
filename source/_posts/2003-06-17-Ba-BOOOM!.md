The time was 3:34am and I was alseep. Got a couple of code dreams going on in my head, so I'm not sleeping very soundly, but I am alseep. Then our bedroom lights up like someone hit a 10000 watt stobe and a huge BOOOM shakes the house.

"Holy Shit!" I holler as I sit up in bed.

"What was that?" my bleary wife asks.

"I think the neighbors just got hit by lightning."

So here I am at almost 4 in the morning wandering around my house making sure everything is ok. Making sure the neighbor's house isn't on fire. Making sure my servers hadn't crashed. :) Everything appeared fine, so I went back to bed. It took me a little while to fall alseep though...

I couldn't stop counting the time between the lightning flashes and the booms.
