I spent an hour and a half last night going through the WSV200 "Overview of ASP.NET 'Whidbey'" on the live PDC Content site. I've decided to start watching one session a night so I can catch up on all the material I didn't see when I was there. :) 

I'm also&nbsp_place_holder;rebuilding a Whidbey VPC image (I accidentally lost my other one when my old computer dumped), so I can start working through the Hands on Labs. Yippee! 

  * [Denver Pragmatic Practitioners](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?DenverPractitioners) - We had our [first meeting](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?DenverPractitioners/November_24_03) on Monday and I forgot to mention it. [Gordon](http://www.eighty-twenty.net/blog/programming/a1025.html) and [Brad](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/003978.shtml) didn't forget though. 
  * [Digger for SmartPhone 2003](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/mobile/) - Lutz Roeder is at it again. Put this classic game on your SmartPhone. It is .NET, though so you have to be running SmartPhone 2003. Anyone know if/when I can upgrade my [MPx200](http://www.mpx200.org/)? (Source is available) 
  * [Agile Software Development Statistics](http://www.dacs.dtic.mil/techs/agile/) - Darrell Norton [points us to an article](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/posts/4033.aspx) that gives us some interesting statistics about agile projects. The best ones: 15-23% increase in productivity, 5-7% decrease in costs, 25-50% reduction in time-to-market. Good stuff. 
  * [XAML for .NET 1.1](http://www.xamlon.com/) - I wondered when someone would do this. It is an interesting idea. I wonder if it will work. Too bad it isn't open source... [via [Chris Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=971)]
