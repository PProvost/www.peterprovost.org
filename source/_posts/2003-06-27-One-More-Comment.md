The movie is over now and I must admit the battle scenes in the final hour are amazing. Without a doubt some of the best CGI I've seen to date. The Yoda fight scene is cool. The fact that they've left hanging how Cancellor Palpatine is going to come out of the closet is interesting.

And then Lucas goes all sappy again and closes with a dumb-ass wedding scene between Anakin and Amidala! Argh!
