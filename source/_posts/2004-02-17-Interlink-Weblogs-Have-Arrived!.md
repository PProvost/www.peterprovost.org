Well, after much preaching, I finally convinced a few Interlinker to start blogging. And even better, I convinced the bosses to let me setup a .TEXT server.

The address is [weblogs.ilg.com](http://weblogs.ilg.com/) and we have a few people who've started posting. We have some developers, some network engineers and some managers. Should be interesting.

Here are a couple of highlights:

  * [Thoughts on Continuous Integration](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/02/15/148.aspx) - Kris Syverstad's first blog post is about his recent experience with CI. Hopefully he'll be posting a lot more soon!
  * [Microsoft Data Access Application Block Bug](http://weblogs.ilg.com/caustin/archive/2004/02/16/150.aspx) - Chris Austin has found what he thinks is a bug. I told him that it is probably there by design. Opinions?
  * [Syverstad's Software Development Standing Orders](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/02/17/167.aspx) - Kris Syverstad and I have been playing around with a military organization for software development and he has started a category on his blog for his thoughts on the subject. His first post is interesting.├é I don't agree with all of it (comments?), but I like what he's trying to do.

One thing of note is that I think I prefer .TEXT to dasBlog. I'm sorry Clemens, but it is true. I want the Articles section and I'm sick of waiting for it and I'm too lazy to write it.

Maybe I'll switch to .TEXT one of these days... I wonder if I can a) easilly port my content [probably] and b) keep all the old links working [maybe]. We'll see.
