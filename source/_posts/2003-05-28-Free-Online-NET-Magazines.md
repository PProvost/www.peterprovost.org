About every month or so, I take a look at [MSDN Magazine Online](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag). It is basically the whole magazine online, for FREE.

Now [Roy Osherove points out ](http://dotnetweblogs.com/rosherove/posts/7672.aspx)that the [current issue of .NET Developers Journal ](http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet/archivesc.cfm?volume=01&Issue=05)is also available online. I wonder if Sys-Con will keep this up or if they are just trying to entice me to subscribe.
