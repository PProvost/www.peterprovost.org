Last week I got an email from Jeff Sandquist asking me for my snail mail address, 'cause the Longhorn team wanted to send me something. Apparently because I registered by blog at [PDCBloggers.net](http://pdcbloggers.net/), the Longhorn team decided I was worthy.

He also asked that I not blog about this until I received my gift. Well...

It came today. A black T-Shirt that says "I'm Blogging This" on the front with a nice big PDC logo on the back.

Thanks Jeff!

PS. I don't have a way to scan it in, but I'm sure somone else will do that soon enough.
