I've written about this before, but it seems to have gotten a lot of attention on WinTechOffTopic last week. I prefer to NOT use ASP.NET Web Projects. I prefer to use Class Library projects instead.

Not always, of course, but on larger projects with many developers and a centralized build system? Absolutely. My big thing is that I hate that the Web Project always goes under wwwroot and that it requires IIS to build. Very annoying since it really is just a class library.

Apparently, I'm not the only one who feels this way. [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/), [Fritz Onion](http://staff.develop.com/onion/), [Craig Andera](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/) and many others chimed in with a similar preference.

In fact, Fritz has written [a little reference](http://staff.develop.com/onion/Samples/aspdotnet_without_web_projects.htm) on the steps you need to take to enable .ASPX pages in a Class Library project. Thanks Fritz.
