I remember seeing someone blog about a cool laptop stand that holds your computer upright on your desk. You would open your laptop all the way and slide it into the stand, and it would the laptop upright so the screen was up at eye level. As I recall, the keyboard was tucked inside and the screen stuck out the top. 

Does anyone remember seeing something like this out there? Please post a comment if you remember what I'm talking about.
