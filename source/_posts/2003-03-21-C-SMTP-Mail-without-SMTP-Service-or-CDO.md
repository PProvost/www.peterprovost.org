I've been looking for [this](http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20030316.asp) for a long time. I hate that sending email from a .NET program requires CDO. Well now it doesn't. This class does SMTP directly using TCP. I've been thinking about writing this for a long time... in fact I have a few half-assed attempts laying around that work but aren't ready for prime time. [This one](http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20030316.asp) looks like it is much better.
