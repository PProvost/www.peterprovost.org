So my wife and I found out on Friday that we are going to have a boy in July. She's been predicting a boy since we found out that we were pregnant, but I wasn't sure. After seeing the "parts" on the ultrasound, I'm convinced. We are all very excited and I have to admit, knowing the gender really does make the name game a little easier. :) 

  * [New Longhorn Screenshots](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?id=17438&category=main) - Courtesy of Neowin.net, here are shots of build 4053. Apparently nothing new since the PDC build. [via [Stephano Demiliani](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/demiliani/archive/2004/02/11/6989.aspx)]
  * [QueryDom](http://gianluca.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33) - Here is a resurrection of an old idea (I attempted something like this in C++ years ago). A DOM (Document Object Model) that you can use to generate dynamic SQL queries.
  * [XmlSerializer Leak](http://weblogs.asp.net/pwilson/archive/2004/02/11/71514.aspx) - Paul Wilson found a nice little memory leak in XmlSerializer. If you use this class very much (I sure do), you should read this post.
  * [Dynamically Adding <head> Content in ASP.NET](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/BsBlog/archive/2004/02/11/7052.aspx) - Brendan Tompkins proposes an interesting solution to this problem. I've always just used a Placeholder, but his trick should work too.
  * [Allegiance Source Code Released](http://research.microsoft.com/research/allegiance/) - Back in 2000 MS released Allegiance, a team-based online game unlike anything before it. Now you can have the source... only 511MB! If you don't care about the source and just want to play, visit [FreeAllegiance.org](http://freeallegiance.org/).
  * [Simpsons Movie Finally Going to Happen](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/eo/20040211/en_movies_eo/13483) - Matt Groening has been hinting at this for years. Will it be great or will it suck? I wonder...
