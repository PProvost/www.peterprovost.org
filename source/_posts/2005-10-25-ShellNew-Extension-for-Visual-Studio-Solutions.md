I really like creating Solution files before I start adding projects. I like to control where everything goes. But sometimes Visual Studio gets in my way. For example, when you create a new Empty Solution, VS creates a folder for it. Nothing you can do about it.

So I created a ShellNew extenstion to do it for me. Here's how do do the same thing yourself:

  1. Download [this ZIP file](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/SolutionShellNew.zip).
  2. Extract the file "Visual Studio Solution.sln" and put it in your \Windows\ShellNew folder.
  3. Extract the .reg file to your desktop and double click on it.

That should be all you have to do. Now you can right click anywhere and say "New Microsoft Visual Studio Solution". Enjoy!
