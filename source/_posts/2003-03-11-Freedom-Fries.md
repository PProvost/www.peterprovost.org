To quote my good friend Brian, "I love good ol' fashion (sic) American stupidity." Apparently, in the House cafeteria in Washington DC changed the name of "French Fries" to "Freedom Fries" after GOP lawmakers decided to protest French opposition to the war in Iraq. Apparently other restaurants around the country are doing the same thing. Idiots. [Here is an article about it](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/11/politics/main543555.shtml) on CBSNews.com.
