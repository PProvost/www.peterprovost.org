I can't believe I've never seen this before. This has got to be one of the coolest ideas I've ever seen. Granted, I'm only halfway through reading it, and I havn't attended a bootcamp, but it appears to solve many of the problems I've seen in group/team communications.

The basic idea is to provide a set of communication protocols for meetings. There are rules about how to join a meeting, leave a meeting, make decisions, etc. I can't give it justice here, so please [read it online](http://www.mccarthy-tech.com/thecore10.pdf).
