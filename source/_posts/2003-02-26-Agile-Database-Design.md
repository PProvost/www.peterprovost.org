I haven't read this yet, but anything like this from Fowler deserves attention:

> [_Martin Fowler_](http://www.martinfowler.com/)_ and Pramod Sadalage have written an article about _[_Evolutionary Database Design_](http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html)_. This is a good starting point for all of us trying to do agile processes with database heavy projects. I'm looking forward to seeing the patterns they come up with.
