From [Larry Lessig](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/):

> We have launched a [petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html) to build support for the [Public Domain Enhancement Act](http://eldred.cc/). That act would require American copyright holders to pay $1 fifty years after a work was published. If they pay the $1, the copyright continues. If they don't, the work passes into the public domain. Historical estimates would suggest 98% of works would pass into the pubilc domain after 50 years. The Act would do a great deal to reclaim a public domain.
> 
> This proposal has received a great deal of support. It is now facing some important lobbyists' opposition. We need a public way to begin to demonstrate who the lobbyists don't speak for. This is the first step. 
> 
> If you are an ally in at least this cause, please sign the petition. Please blog it, please email it, please spam it, please buy billboards about it -- please do whatever you can. And most importantly, please help us explain its importance. There is a chance to do something significant here. But it will take a clearer, simpler voice than mine.

Everyone should go sign this. The public domain is slowing going down the tubes, and this may help.
