You know what drives me nuts? HOw people can't seem to understand the difference between the forward slash (/) and the backslash (\). AFAIK, this one is fully BillG's fault. Back in the DOS days (and even in Win9x) those of us who had to provide tech support got into the habit of saying things like, "No not that one... the backslash key... over there." And now, everyone calls the forward slash key backslash! It drives me nuts. 

So I'm listening to the radio yesterday on my way home from work and an H&R Block ad comes on talking about their new online services. "For more information," it says, "visit us online at hrblock.com backslash online". The annoying thing is that this works, because the browser companies have gotten used to people who don't know the difference. 

Ugh!
