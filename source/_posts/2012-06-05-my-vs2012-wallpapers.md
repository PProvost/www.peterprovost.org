I'm getting ready for TechEd 2012 this month and realized I wanted to have a
nice desktop wallpaper for my laptop. Well, I'd not seen any popping up on
twitter or blogs yet, so I grabbed my trusty [GIMP image editor][3] and some
base images of the new VS 2012 logo and got to work.

Here are a few of my favorites, but I've not decided which I will use on my
laptop.

You can see/download them all by clicking on one of the links above or you
browse them on [my SkyDrive][1].  They are all 1680x1050 PNG files and have
been [compressed with PNGOUT][2] to be as small as possible. I may end up
making more so keep an eye on that folder if you're interested.
