Oops. When I switched to dasBlog, I didn't realize that I had left all the people with my old RSS URL in the lurch.

My bad. If I had installed dasBlog in the same folder as my Radio weblog, it would have worked because Clemens wrote a nice regex based redirector that was already configured for this.

But, I put dasBlog in a new folder so none of that code fired. Tonight I added a redirect for IIS to solve it. Sorry.
