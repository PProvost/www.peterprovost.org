So I was at dinner with a bunch of MVPs and some people from the XML and Indigo teams last night and when I saw [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) playing with his [MPx-200](http://commerce.motorola.com/consumer/QWhtml/mpx200.html). 

"So did you get an OS bump yet?" 

"Of course!" he said, "You don't?" 

Well as you can tell by this post... I am still running the old version. And I want to be running the new version. I know that they were doing upgrades for people at MDC, but I didn't get to go to MDC and I want it. 

So as long as I'm here in Seattle/Redmond, does anyone know how/where I can upgrade my damn phone? If I can't do it here, can someone help me? Please? 

Pretty please?
