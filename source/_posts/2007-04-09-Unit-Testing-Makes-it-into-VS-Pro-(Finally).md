One of the more popular and commented on posts on this blog was one I made back before joining Microsoft and before VSTS shipped where I tried to start a community push to get Unit Testing into all of the VS SKUs. 

Naysawn Naderi (PM for Developer-Oriented Testing in VSTS) [recently announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/nnaderi/archive/2007/03/27/unit-testing-trickling-into-pro.aspx) that we have made a major step in that direction by getting this capability into the Visual Studio Pro. 

Great work guys!
