Have you noticed how useless the internet and the blogsphere gets on April 1st? It is funny and all that, but I've actually gotten to the point where I just avoid everything on that day. I was forwarded some good ones, like [Visual Studio 2005 on Linux](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=33023), but in general it was all just too annoying.

  * ![Pairon](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/pairon_small.jpg)[PairOn](http://www.cenqua.com/pairon/) - A new two person chair for all your pair programming needs. Yeah, I know this is an April Fool's joke, but this is a good one. Don't you just love that picture?
  * [NewsGator's New Pricing Model](http://j0d4n.typepad.com/teknowledgy/2005/03/newsgator_now_s.html) - I decided shortly after coming to MS that I didn't want my RSS inside of Outlook, so I bailed on NG. But apparently, a number of folks are leaving now for a whole new reason: their new pricing model. [TShak](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/tshak/) pinged me on this last week, asking what I use, and I told him: [OmeaReader](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea_reader/).
  * [More Good Command Line Tricks](http://codebetter.com/blogs/sahil.malik/archive/2005/01/28/48715.aspx) - I use the pushd/popd stuff every day, but I had completely forgotten about F7. Cool.
  * [A Comparative Look at Some Ruby Idioms](http://renaud.waldura.com/doc/ruby/idioms.shtml) - I think I've mentioned that Ruby is my language of the year, and while digging for help with some problem or another, I found this useful article. And while I've got you thinking about Ruby, take a look at the [Ruby QuickRef](http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/QuickRef.html).
  * [Google Does Weather](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=weather+redmond%2C+WA) - I assume everyone else saw this earlier this monthΓÇª just type "weather <city>, <state>" and you'll get a four day weather forecast. This link is for Redmond, WA. [via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/05/google_search_now_of.html)]
  * [UN Landmine Commercial](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/07/un_landmine_commeric.html) - Another one from Boing Boing. While this commercial is work-friendly (i.e. no nudity) it is very startling and may not be appropriate for all viewers.
