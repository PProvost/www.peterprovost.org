Don, Chris, Dmitri, Larry and the rest of the Web Service Software Factory team have shipped their December release. Congratulations to them for their hard work and for this excellent addition to the space.

This software factory provides support for WCF and ASMX based services. You can get all the details from [Don Smith's post about the release](http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/archive/2007/01/09/come-and-get-yer-service-factory.aspx).

A few other intersting tidbits:

  * Aaron Skonnard has just published [an article on MSDN about this release](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/02/ServiceStation/default.aspx)
  * [Tom Hollander has posted some information](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2006/11/26/installing-gat-gax-and-factories-under-windows-vista.aspx) about the right (and wrong) way to install GAX-based software factories on Vista.
  * Don recently wrote [an article about Handcrafting WCF-friendly WSDL files](http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/archive/2006/10/06/Handcrafting-WCF_2D00_friendly-WSDLs.aspx) that is worth reading, especially if you are a WSDL-first person (like me)

Enjoy!
