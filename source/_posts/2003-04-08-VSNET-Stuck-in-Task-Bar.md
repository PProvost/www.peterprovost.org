Has anyone else ever experienced this? I often use the "Show Desktop" shortcut in the Quick Launch bar to minimize all open windows. Every now and then, and I can't find a pattern, VS.NET gets stuck in the task bar and won't restore when you click on it. The only way to restore it is to bring up Task Manager, select VS.NET and click "Switch Tp".

Very annoying.
