I only recently discovered [Dave Thomas' blog](http://pragprog.com/pragdave) (of [Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/) fame). As I was working my way through the excellent content to be found there, I discovered his CodeKata pieces. (Links: [1](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/CodeKata.rdoc,v), [2](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataOne.rdoc,v), [3](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/MoreKata.rdoc,v), [4](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataTwo.rdoc,v), [5](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataThree.rdoc,v), [6](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataFour.rdoc,v), [7](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataFive.rdoc,v)). This is a wonderful idea and I can't believe I haven't seen anyone else blogging about them.

The basic idea is that to be an expert programming you must practice. Dave equates this to Karate and defines a set of Kata (exercises) to use as practice material. He has posted 5 Kata at this point, and I intend to start doing them regularly. 

30-60 minutes a night working on small, well-defined bits of code... practice, practice, practice.
