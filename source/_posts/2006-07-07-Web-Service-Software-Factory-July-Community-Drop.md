And would you like automated guidance to help you build your own applications that comply with a proven architecture? Then check out the July Communtiy Drop of the Web Service Software Factory. In addition to providing a reference implementation, written and automated guidance around building service interfaces with ASMX, this latest drop includes a new data access guidance package that makes it easy to build a data access layer using the Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block.
