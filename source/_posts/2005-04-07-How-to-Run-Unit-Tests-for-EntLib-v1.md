Apparently people are having issues running the unit tests in EntLib. There is [a thread on the EntLib workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/messageboard/thread.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327&threadid=060c1685-5ee7-4b0d-b0e9-cad81116d600) where this is being discussed.

Brian Button has kindly posted [a write-up on his blog explaining what you need to do](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/archive/2005/04/07/3162.aspx) to get started using the tests.

BTW, Tom Hollander has posted [a survey about the EntLib unit tests](http://www.zoomerang.com/recipient/survey-intro.zgi?p=WEB2249C9QABBU). If you care about such things, please take 30 seconds and fill it out, as it will help us learn more about what you (our customers) think of these things.
