I have to admit, I hate the "description" field that many bloggers use. I understand why it exists, but I hate the way it is used. Here is my problem...

I don't really like it when I have to double click a posting in SharpReader and then wait for a browser window to open showing me the page. If your weblog engine only sends me the description field, however, that is exactly what I have to do.

If you are like [Chris Brumme](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/cbrumme/) and write 9000+ word essays on .NET internal stuff, then fine, use the description to tell me what's in there. But many posts have descriptions like "A cool piece of software" that describe a 100 word post about something. Just go ahead and ship me the 100 words and save me the hassle of clicking through to see what the hell you're talking about.

Thanks.
