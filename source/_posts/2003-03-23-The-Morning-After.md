So I got home from Aaron's party at about 3:15 am. Much later than I am used to these days. I crash into the bed and suddenly it is 6:30 am and [Hadley](http://www.provost.org/the-kid.asp) is hollering for someone to come get her out of her crib. Ugh. [Em](http://www.provost.org/emily-provost.asp) let me sleep in yesterday, so today is my turn.

Then about 10 minutes after Em got up, I had to head back downtown to finish the construction job. We basically finished everything except some sanding. Whew. Tired again.
