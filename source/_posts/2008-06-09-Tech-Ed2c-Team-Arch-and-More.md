I'm back from TechEd 2008 Developer where we showed off not only our VSTS 2008 stuff but spent a lot of time talking about our Rosario features and in particular our UML support. 

We got some time in the Billg keynote which was great, had thousands of excited customers come by our booth and I did a session all about Team Arch Rosario on Friday. 

Feedback has been continuously positive and we're all very excited about what we're doing and about how customers are feeling about it. The UML direction seems to be very positive so far. 

Also, via Mark Groves I found another blogger talking about our stuff, this time with a demo video of Reverse Engineering UML Sequence Diagrams from code. I've yet to do a demo of this where people don't get excited.

Enjoy!
