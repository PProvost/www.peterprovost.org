From Chris Sells Windows Developer News:

> _Sorry for the long wait. There's been two whole books written between the last release of Genghis and this one. Here's the list of new features:  
  
-Everything works under .NET 1.0 and 1.1 (except HandleCollector)  
  
-MSN Messanger-style popup window  
  
-UI Type Editor for use with ImageList index selection  
  
-AppBar implementation  
  
-Text file search  
  
-Themed controls  
  
-Single instance application support, including passing command line args from other instances  
  
-Multiple top-level window support  
  
-Many enhancements and fixes to the command line parser  
  
-Splash screen class  
  
-Improved WebCommandLineHelper class which now works with .NET 1.0 and 1.1, includes URL decoding and requires no additional permissions (although it does require a server-side HTTP handler, included as the ConfigFileHandler class that maps requests for foo.exe?bar=quux.config to the foo.exe.config file)  
  
-WizardSheet updates  
  
-Status Bar Extender for mapping status messages to Windows Forms controls  
  
Thanks to my new build master, Mike Marshal, who got all of this together. He's the greatest!_

I've used Genghis on a couple of projects and it is a very nice extension library. And since it is from Chris Sells, you know its good.
