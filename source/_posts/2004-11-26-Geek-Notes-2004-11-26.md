Boy, campus was s a graveyard Wednesday. It seems that everyone took an extended vacation this week. As a new employee, I was at work. Yesterday we had a great Thanksgiving dinner in our new house. Since he is here without his family this month, [Scott Densmore](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/) joined us. We ate too much, drank too much and had a great time.

  * [Regex for RFC822](http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html) - Parsing email addresses with a regex is notoriously hard, but this regex is apparently very close. But is is possible the biggest, ugliest regex I've ever seen and I haven't tried it with the .NET Regex class either.
  * [Science Geek in the Kitchen](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/dining/24SCIE.html?oref=login&oref=login&pagewanted=1&hp) - What happens when a geek gets into the kitchen on Thanksgiving? (free registration required)
  * [Taxonomy for Bad Code "Smells"](http://www.soberit.hut.fi/mmantyla/BadCodeSmellsTaxonomy.htm) - Mika M├â┬ñntyl├â┬ñ originally created this list as part of his masters thesis and is now maintaining it online.
  * [PureText 2.0](http://stevemiller.net/PureText/) - I often copy-paste from IE, Outlook or Word into BlogJet or an email message and want only the plain text, without any formatting. This tool makes that really easy.
  * [Place Holder Pages in SharePoint Site Definitions](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/11/24/550.aspx) - Kris Syverstad has finally blogged a technique that he and Scott Pachelo use for leaving extension points in SP site defs. Also Kris is publicly [showing off his most recent SP project](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/11/23/547.aspx). Check it out. It is the most customized SharePoint implementation I've ever heard of.
  * [Grey Video](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/11/18/the_grey.shtml) - Remember the mashup of The Beatles White Album and Jay-Z's The Black Album? It was called [The Grey Album](http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html) and now someone has made a cool video to go along with one of the tracks.
  * [TiVo Sells Your Fast Forward Button](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/11/tivo_to_add_ban.html) - TiVo announced that starting next year they will be showing banner ads when you fast-forward. That itself isn't all that annoying, but what is annoying--perhaps even disturbing--is that if you accidentally press the wrong button during one of those ads, they will send your personal information to the advertiser. Ugh.

**Now playing:** [The Kleptones](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=The Kleptones) - [Rock](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=Rock&artistTerm=The Kleptones)
