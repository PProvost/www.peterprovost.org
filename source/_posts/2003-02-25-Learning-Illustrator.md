As a certified code-writing geek, I don't spend very much professional time doing graphic design. And for good reason... I suck. Just ask [Aaron](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/default.htm). 

Regardless, I spent a couple of hours working in Adobe Illustrator tonight preparing a site design comp for a customer who got left in the lurch when her graphic designer backed out at the last minute. I think I did a pretty good job and certainly learned a lot about using Illustrator.

One thing that surprises me is how few good Illustrator tutorials there are out there. There are lots of good sites for Photoshop, but it seems that people either teach themselves Illustrator or learn it in school.

Has anyone else out there found any good Illustrator sites?
