Whew. I'm done, for now. For those of you who are interested, here is what I did:

  1. I created a new theme called Longhorn that is derived from the Longhorn Slate Theme from the PDC bits.
  2. I got rid of all the categories I had been using and cut it down to one category for my weblog, one category for articles and one category for content about me.
  3. I uploaded my current blogroll from NewsGator. It turns out that the OPML generated by NewsGator isn't compatible with dasBlog, so I had to do some search-and-replace tweaking.
  4. I got rid of the classic blog calendar. I'm not convinced that it is worth having. Anyone who thinks I should put it back, please post a comment.
  5. I cleaned up my Links section. It was full of a number of links that have been rolled up into my new Categories.

Whew. That took most of the day (when I wasn't playing with my daughter).
