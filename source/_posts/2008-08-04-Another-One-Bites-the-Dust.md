On Friday I repaved my laptop again. As many of you know, I do this about every 6-8 weeks, but now that I return to Redmond once a month, I've started aligning my repaves with my trips to take advantage of the corporate PXE installation services. This one was after two trips, which was about 8 or 9 weeks.

It is amazing how fast I'm getting at this. The more you do it, the more you organize yourself to make it easy, the easier it gets.

Within three hours I had my machine back to usable. In the few days since then I've installed things as I've needed them, using my previous repave notes as a guide for things I might've forgotten.

Here's the list this time (so far):

  * IT Supported Vista SP1 x86 + Office + eTrust
  * Configure Bluetooth Mouse 
  * ISA Firewall Client 
  * Office Communicator 
  * Configure Consolas as System Font 
  * Wow 
  * Flash Player for IE 
  * Ventrilo 3.0.1 
  * Zune Player 
  * HotKeyPlus 
  * Firefox 3.1 
  * Java Runtime 
  * Powershell 1.0 for Vista
  * Sidebar plugins: 
    * All CPU Meter 
    * Wired Network Meter 
    * Wireless Network Meter 
    * Woot! 
  * NcFTP 
  * PasswordMinder 
  * GnuWin32 
  * Chatzilla 
  * Live Messenger 
  * Vim 7.1 
  * 7zip 
  * ctrl2cap 
  * LiveWriter Technical Preview 
  * Flash Player for Firefox 
  * Firefox Profile 
  * Launch and Setup Outlook 
  * ooVoo 
  * My Profile Stuff (Desktop, Docs, Music, etc.)
  * Adobe Acrobat Reader
  * Twhirl

I blogged about this process once before over here: [Another Agile Computer Repave Done](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/post/Another-Agile-Computer-Repave-Done.aspx)
