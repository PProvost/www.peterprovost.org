I wouldn't be surprised if something like this solves the spam problem once and for all.

> _Longtime friend Bob O'Brien is working hard in his Silicon Valley computer room to give us all an answer to spam. I remember Bob well. He'd give me heck in the DevX newsgroups everytime DevX would send out some spam. He got so angry (not just at DevX, either) that he spent a while researching the problem. He's come up with an interesting system, that I'll soon be beta testing. It's called "receptionist" and the way he describes it, it'll be a much simpler way to reduce the amount of spam currently making its way into all our in boxes. Oh yeah. He wants to give it away for free and make it a community project. It's coming soon to _[_http://www.whitelist.com/_](http://www.whitelist.com/)_ . [_[_The Scobleizer Weblog_](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/)_]_

I use [CloudMark SpamNet](http://www.cloudmark.com/products/spamnet/) which uses a Napster style approach to blacklisting spam. It works pretty well, but it doesn't actually stop the message from being delivered in the first place. The [Receptionist Protocol](http://www.whitelist.com/protocol.html) listed at [http://www.whitelist.com](http://www.whitelist.com) looks like it could actually STOP ALL SPAM. It is too bad that they are making the free version so limited, but I would guess that if they publish the protocol, we will see lots of additional implementations. I'd like to do an implementation that plugs into Exchange Server and stops it before it even arrives. Someday maybe...
