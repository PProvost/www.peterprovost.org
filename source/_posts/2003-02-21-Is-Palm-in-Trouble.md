A couple of articles have popped up lately that have caught my eye. Yesterday I saw that [Steve Sakoman left PalmSource](http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=5033), the software development division of Palm, Inc. Steve came to PalmSource from Be (which he co-founded) and Apple. Apparently a large number of the developers who came to Palm Source from Be stayed mostly due to loyalty to Steve. One has to wonder how long they'll stay with him gone.

Then this morning, I heard on NPR that [Palm's appeal in its case against has been dismissed](http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2003/0221palmappea.html). Xerox sued Palm for violating its patent on input technology. Xerox claims that Palm's Graffiti input system in in violation of its patent and is demanding that all offending products be pulled from the shelves.

OUCH! I wonder if Palm can weather this?
