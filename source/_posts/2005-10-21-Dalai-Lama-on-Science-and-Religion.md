Just saw this today on [eSkeptic](http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/archives/2005/05-10-19.html):

> My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation: if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims. 
> 
> - His Holiness the Dalai Lama from his book _The Universe in a Single Atom_

Gotta love that quote. I have great respect for that man.
