This looks interesting. [Fabrice ](http://www.dotnetweblogs.com/fmarguerie/)wrote a plug in for [.NET Reflector ](http://www.aisto.com/Roeder/DotNet/)that dynamically generates a UML sequence diagram for a method. The sequence steps are basically the methods called by the method you are diagramming. An interesting idea. Since he released [the source code](http://madgeek.com/Samples/SequenceBrowser.030507.zip), it'll be interesting to see if anyone takes this anywhere.
