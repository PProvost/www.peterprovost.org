Last night at about 11:30, just as I was falling asleep, I heard our attic fan turn off. Looking over at my alarm clock,├é I noticed that everything seemed to me off. Shit, power it out again.

There was [lightning and flooding all over Denver last night](http://www.9news.com/storyfull.asp?id=15528) and this has happened before, so I wasn't too worried. They normally get it back up within an hour. So I went back to sleep and hoped it was on in time for my alarm clock to wake me in the morning.

Nope. I sat up straight at 7:45 AM wondering why the damn power wasn't├é back on. I had an 8AM meeting, so I didn't have time to do anything other than make sure all of my circuit breakers were closed and have a quick chat with a neighbor to make sure I wasn't the only one. 

Hopefully they'll get it back on soon. My [18 month old daughter](http://www.provost.org/the-kid.asp) probably wants to watch Blues Clues. :)
