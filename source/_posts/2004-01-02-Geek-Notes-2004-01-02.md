What a year 2003 was, eh? Tech-weblogging goes crazy... LOTR finished with a bang... PDC 2003 showed us Longhorn, Whidbey and more... Windows SmartPhones finally hit the US... G-Dub is still President (somehow)... The company I co-founded crahed and burned... Then I got a new job... 

Whew! 

  * [Getting Started with ObjectSpaces](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/nl/msdn/community/columns/jtielens/objectspaces.mspx) - We are finally starting to see some MSDN content about ObjectSpaces. This article is from the Belgium/Luxembourg site... [via [The Daily Grind](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind261.html)]
  * [SmartBarXP](http://www.smartbarxp.com/cgi-bin/main.cgi?parent=main&display=news) - Do you want the Longhorn Sidebar now? On your Windows XP machine? Get get SmartBarXP and you'll have exactly that.
  * [Window Blinds](http://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/) - OK, so you have the side bar, but maybe you want [the Slate theme](http://wincustomize.com/skins.asp?library=1&SkinID=3665)... install Window Blinds and you've got that. Why wait for Longhorn? (Just kidding of course.)
  * [The Theory of Everything (still waiting)](http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/12/31.html#a538) - Early & Adopter rant on about the disconnect between object technologies and relational databases. I agree with them... "we have a different theory for eveything. I want the Theory of Everything." [Tim Bray responded](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/31/HeWantsEverything), as did [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-01-01T09:52:07Z) and [Dare Obasanjo](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-01-01T09:52:07Z).
  * - I'm just wrapping up a project in C++ that uses ATL. I wish I'd found this before we started. It looks like a very well thought out replacement for ATL that is inherently STL friendly. Cool. Here is the [Comet homepage](http://www.lambdasoft.dk/comet/).
