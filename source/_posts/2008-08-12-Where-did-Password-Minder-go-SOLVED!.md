I've long been a fan of [Keith Brown](http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/default.aspx)'s Password Minder program for keeping all my passwords and other sensitive information safe.

Imagine my frustration then when last week I couldn't find it to download onto my new ly repaved laptop. Yeah, I had a backup copy, but I like to get newer versions of things when I repave to keep these things up to date.

It seemed that Pluralsight's web presence had been completely redone (good) but the Tools page was done (bad).

Today after checking back to see any updates, I found a [post by Keith](http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2008/08/05/where-to-get-password-minder.aspx) with a new link:

Whew! It isn't dead. :)
