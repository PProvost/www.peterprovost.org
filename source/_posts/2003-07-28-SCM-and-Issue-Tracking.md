A lot of bloggers have been writing about Vault lately. Very cool I must say, but why isn't anyone talking about [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) (aka SVN)?

SVN has at least one major point in favor of it over Vault: It is FREE! It is released under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt), which is nice, has a core of dedicated developers and it is getting to be pretty damn stable. Of course if using an alpha-version SCM bothers you, you can always use [CVSNT](http://www.cvsnt.org/wiki/) which is also FREE.

One of the things about Vault that I do like a lot&nbsp_place_holder;is [its integration with FogBUGZ](http://weblogs.asp.net/mlafleur/posts/9665.aspx). It is very nice when your SCM integrates with your issue/bug tracking system.

This got me thinking... why hasn't anyone ported [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) to .NET and SQL Server?

If I can find the time, I'm going to tackle this project. If anyone is interested in helping me on this, I would love it.
