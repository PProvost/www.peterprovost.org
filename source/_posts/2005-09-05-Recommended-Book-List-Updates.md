I just did a bit of catch up on my recommended book list (in the left side bar of the blog for those of you who only read me via RSS). Here's what I added:

  * [![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Images/Books/0131177052.png)Working Effectively With Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0131177052/peterprovosto-20) by Michael Feathers - When talking about TDD and unit testing around MS, this is almost always one of the first books I recommend. To Michael, legacy code is code that doesn't have effective unit tests. 
  * [Customizing the Microsoft .NET Framework Common Language Runtime](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0735619883/peterprovosto-20) by Steve Pratschner - This is one of those books that is an interesting read, because you don't really need the information provided but it is really cool to know how to do it. Then months or years later, when you really do need to know how to host the CLR in your own process (for example), you at least know how to get started.
  * [Extreme Programming Pocket Guide](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596004850/peterprovosto-20) by Chromatic - If anyone ever asks you to recommend one and only one book to explain XP, consider this one. I remember when I first saw it on Ward Cunningham's desk. I asked if it was okay and he said, "He got it all... in one little book. That's why I wrote the forward."
  * [Pragmatic Version Control Using Subversion](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0974514063/peterprovosto-20) by Mike Mason - Another book in the Pragmatic series, this time about my favorite open-source version control system: [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/).
