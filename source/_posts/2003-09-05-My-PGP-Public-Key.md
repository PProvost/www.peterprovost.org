I wanted to post my PGP Public Key here in case anyone is looking for it. I had it on my old site, but it wasn't listed here. <strike>Here is the ASC file for download</strike>:

UPDATE 2004-05-02: To avoid the DRY Principle, I have pulled that link. If you are looking for my PGP Public Key, please visit [this page](http://www.peterprovost.org/articles/1174.aspx).
