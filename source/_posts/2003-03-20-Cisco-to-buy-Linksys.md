> [_News.Com_](http://rss.com.com/2100-1035-993457.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news)_: "Networking giant Cisco Systems on Wednesday said it would buy Linksys, a manufacturer of networking gear for consumers, in a stock deal valued at $500 million." [_[_Scripting News_](http://www.scripting.com/)_]_

I hope this doesn't make Linksys prices go up.
