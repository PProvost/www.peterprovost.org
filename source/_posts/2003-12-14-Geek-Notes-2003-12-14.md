Spent most of yesterday playing around with ObjectSpaces in Whidbey. A colleague and I are considering a book on it, so we need to get our hands around it very quickly. So far so good... 

  * [The .NET Entity Objects Framework](http://neo.sourceforge.net/) - Aka NEO, this package is from the good people at ThoughtWorks. It looks to be yet another code generator that produces an object facade on top of your ADO.NET data store. At first glance, this looks like a well thought out framework, so if you need something before Whidbey, you should check it out. 
  * [MSDE 2000 Deployment Toolkit (Release Candidate)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=6e9a7403-c4ba-4d98-bb0b-2c9d6414071f&displaylang=en) - The MSDE 2000 Deployment Toolkit is a plug-in to Microsoft Visual Studio that automates the process of creating an integrated package with both the application and the MSDE database. 
  * [Google Tracks Packages](http://www.google.com/help/features.html#number) - And much more... 
  * [How to Force Outlook to Send .EXEs](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/adam/posts/439.aspx) - Adam Field shows us a registry hack to make outlook send EXEs and other files... 
  * [Ward Cunningham Takes the Red Pill](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TipsForWardAtMicrosoft) - The inventor of the Wiki and author of a number of important works has joined Microsoft. Boy, MS is just gobbling up all the smarties aren't they? [via [DevHawk](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6e7c2137-7b31-4494-bf37-a78f238b5512)] 
  * [Authentication in ASP.NET](http://weblogs.asp.net/srinathv/posts/42838.aspx) - Srinath Vasireddy posts [an image](http://dotnetsweatshop.blogspot.com/AuthNProcessFlow.jpg) that helps explain a lot. 

Whew. That's what I get for skipping yesterday! 

For those of you interested in the Motorola MPx-200 SmartPhone, there are [rumours](http://www.smartfone.net/forums/showthread.php?s=0babcda31ebaaf5dffd04affdda4113a&threadid=78) that Motorola will have an upgrade from SmartPhone 2002 to SmartPhone 2003 (which is .NET enabled). Sounds like Feb/March '04. I can't wait.
