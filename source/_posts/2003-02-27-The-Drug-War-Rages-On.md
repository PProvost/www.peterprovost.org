I really like [this video](http://www.mpp.org/WarOnDrugCzar/video/MPP_comm1_broad.wmv). Since 9/11 the gov't has been pushing ads at us telling us that buying drugs (specifically marijuana) gives money to terrorists. As the video points out, however, if you take 15 seconds to analyze the logic there, the answer is...

Legalize Marijuana!
