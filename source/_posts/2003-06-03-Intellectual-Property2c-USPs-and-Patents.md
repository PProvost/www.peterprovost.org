[Excellent post](http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/posts/8165.aspx) from [Frans Bouma](http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/). It is way too long to copy here, but here is my favorite part (about software patents):

> This is also the reason why I think software patents are a bad thing: they do not help to get an advantage over a competitor, but they do give a false feeling of having that advantage, which├é makes patent holders├é to focus on their patent instead of their USP's which really matter. In the end the customer, the end user, is the one who really looses: he has to wait till the competition has worked around the patent, and├é till then he├é probably won't have the├é product he wants, because the patent holder is not forced to focus on USP's which will bring that├é product.
