A few weeks ago at the Redmond _patterns & practices_ Summit I joined Ron Jacobs, Eugenio Pace and Wojtek Kozaczynski for a chat about the new Smart Client Baseline Architecture Toolkit project (aka SC-BAT). Today, Ron posted [an audio podcast of that session](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=152086) to Channel 9. Here's the description from the site: 

> Have you ever wished that someone would just tell you how to build the thing you want to build?&nbsp_place_holder; Like one of those do-it-yourself furniture projects?&nbsp_place_holder; Well if you are building a Smart Client application the patterns & practices team has just what you need in the Smart Client Baseline Architecture Toolkit (SC-BAT).&nbsp_place_holder; Recorded live at the [patterns & practices summit](http://www.pnpsummit.com/) in Redmond this session features Eugenio Pace, Peter Provost and Wojtek Kozaczynski detailing what SC-BAT is and how it will help you. 

If you weren't able to attend, please [check it out](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=152086).
