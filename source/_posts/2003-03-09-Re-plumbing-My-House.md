It wasn't the project we planned to do, but [my dad](http://www.provost.org/Gerry/) and I just finished re-plumbing my entire house. I had a bad mixture of old galvanized steel and copper, with a tiny bit of PVC. We had planned on doing a partial finish of the basement, but when we realized that I had water pipes crossing where the hallway would be, we decided to move them. What was supposed to be done on Friday didn't get finished until Sunday. So, we didn't do any actual framing. But I did learn how to re-plumb a house.
