I just posted the new blog skin that I've been working on for the past few days. I completely revamped the layout and tried to consolidate what was links on the side into pages that can be reached from the toolbar.

For those those of you reading this in your RSS aggregator, I'd love it if you could take 30 seconds and visit the HTML version. Comments and (constructive) criticisms will be appreciated.

Here's to a great 2004.
