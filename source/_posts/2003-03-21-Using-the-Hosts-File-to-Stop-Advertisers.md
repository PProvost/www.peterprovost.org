I first ran across this a while back and completely forgot about it. Basically the idea is to put entries in your hosts file for advertisement URLs that point back to your own IP address. Since the host file gets checked before DNS, and since your machine almost certainly won't have the advertisement file(s), nothing should display. Give it a try.
