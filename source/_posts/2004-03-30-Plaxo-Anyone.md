I recently got pinged by [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) to update his Plaxo record and I decided to look at this product again. It still seems to be free, which is cool. But it makes me wonder... how are they making money? They claim not to be selling my contact information or lists, so where can they create revenue? 

Is anyone else out there using [Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com/)? The Outlook integration is pretty seamless. I must admit I'm impressed (anyone know how they got their icon into the Outlook Preview window?).
