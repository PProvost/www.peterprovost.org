The Prescriptive Architecture group at MS has released [Prescriptive Architecture Guide for .NET Alerts Integration with Existing Notification Mechanisms](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5dd53f9e-afa6-4cae-8cfe-8966378d9a3e&displaylang=en). Haven't read it yet, but it looks interesting.
