Depending on where you live, DevDays 2004 should be happening pretty soon. Here in Denver it will be on March 18, but the opening session in New York was yesterday.

It is only $99 and I'll tell you that the security information alone is worth it. Getting a preview copy of VS.NET codename "Whidbey" is even better. Throw in all the information and training and it is a bargain.
