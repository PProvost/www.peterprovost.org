Today Microsoft announced extended IP Indemnification for a very large set of products to end-users. (It was only really extended to volume license holders before today.) The only exception will be for embedded versions of Windows, since vendors are able to modify the source code.

For more information you can [read the press release here](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/nov04/11-10IPProtectionPR.asp) or get more information from the [Windows Server System site](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/facts/indemnification/default.mspx).

As expected, [the Slashdotters are calling it FUD](http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/04/11/10/1553243.shtml?tid=109&tid=123&tid=201&tid=1), but I expect that major customers who are not volume licensees will appreciate it.
