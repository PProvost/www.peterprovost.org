This interesting little tidbit was posted to the WinTech OffTopic Mailing List. The part that got my attention was this:

> 4. Guidelines for Point-by-Point Replies vs. Summary Replies.
> 
> In replies that specifically respond to individual sentences, paragraphs, or points to the original message at least (3) three times, Point-by-Point replies may be used.&nbsp_place_holder; All other forms of replies shall be in the format of summary replies.
> 
> The purpose of the Summary reply is to give proper emphasis on the reply. The reply is the focal point of the message, and as such,&nbsp_place_holder; that's what the readers are reading the message for, the reply. Context is important, but as in written communication, it is secondary in nature.&nbsp_place_holder; In written communication, footnotes are used, or appendices.&nbsp_place_holder; While electronic communication is not as&nbsp_place_holder;formal, leaving a trimmed copy of the original message for reference is appropriate and should be done where relevant.&nbsp_place_holder; A&nbsp_place_holder;combination of Point-by-Point and Summary shall never be used. In a nutshell, the purpose of a reply is the reply, not to provide a transcript of an entire conversation.&nbsp_place_holder; A trimmed quotes original&nbsp_place_holder;message is always recommended to include with a reply as a reference as relevant.

I wish more people read just this one section. One of the things I hate about reading the WinTech OT List is summary reply messages that have all of the previous messages appended to the bottom. I wish more people would take a little time to clean up their posting. You would do it for your weblog, why not do it for a mailing list?
