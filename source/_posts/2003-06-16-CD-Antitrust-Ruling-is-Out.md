A while back (can't find it now) I posted about how you could sign up for the class action lawsuit against the music companies. The suit has been decided and if you signed up back when I told you to, you should be getting a nice fat check for $13 in the mail.

That'll show 'em.

UPDATE: My check came! Sweet.
