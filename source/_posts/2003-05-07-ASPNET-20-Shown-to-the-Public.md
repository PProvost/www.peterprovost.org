From [Paul Wilson's .NET Blog](http://dotnetweblogs.com/pwilson/):

> _I'm at the DevConnections conference in New Orleans this week and last night's keynote featured _[_Scott Guthrie_](http://dotnetweblogs.com/ScottGu/)_'s first ever public demo of ASP.NET Version 2.0!&nbsp_place_holder; It looks like _[_DataGridGirl_](http://dotnetweblogs.com/datagridgirl/posts/6603.aspx)_ beat me to the scoop about how cool the new grid control will be -- no code for paging and sorting and even editing.&nbsp_place_holder; The other feature he showed was the new sql dependency supported by output caching -- the data is cached as long as you set and is automatically invalidated when it changes in the raw data table.&nbsp_place_holder; He didn't show any of the other cool things that some of us have seen in private, but this was a really cool initial public preview.&nbsp_place_holder; By the way, it was obvious looking at Scott's demo that "Venus" is the codename being used for at least part of ASP.NET v2.0. _
