I├óΓé¼Γäóve been desparately trying to catch up on blogs, work, life and such and have been failing miserably. More on that soon├óΓé¼┬ª

But I wanted to quickly share a blog post titled [Roles in an Agile Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/mpuleio/archive/2006/05/24/606561.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;by Michael Puleio, one of the great agile-minded developers here in patterns & practices. If you aren├óΓé¼Γäót reading his blog, you should be.
