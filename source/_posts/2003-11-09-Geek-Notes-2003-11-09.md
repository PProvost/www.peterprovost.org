Took yesterday off and didn't touch my computer. Today I'm at work (ugh) and taking a 10 minute break to see what's happened while I wasn't looking...

  * [Shrek 2 Movie Trailer](http://www.dreamworks.com/trailers/shrek2/shrek2_tsr_qt_480.mov) - Can it be as good as the first one? We'll see...
  * [Disposable Cell Phones](http://www.hop-on.com/) - Not a bad idea, but where can&nbsp_place_holder;I actually get one?
  * [XML 1.1 and Namespaces in XML 1.1 move to Proposed Recommendation status](http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2099)
  * [Vogels on Amsterdam](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000329.html)&nbsp_place_holder;- Werner is back home and makes some observations about the difference between the American view of drug use and the Dutch view
  * [Don Box Responds to XAML Comments](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-11-08T08:10:13Z) - Everyone and their dog commented, some good and some bad, about Don's "[HelloWorld in XAML](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-11-07T07:41:40Z)" post. Now Don replies.
  * [Expansion in VS.NET Whidbey](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/posts/36274.aspx) - I use QuickCode and love it, but something built into the IDE may be better. I'll have to try this on my Whidbey VM.&nbsp_place_holder;[[via Jeff Key](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/posts/36500.aspx)]
