I've been using [Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 16](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001GU7JC/peterprovosto-20) for the past two weeks in an attempt to finally learn how to type. You'd think that as a programmer from the age of 10 I would have learned to touch-type, but I just never bothered. As a 5-finger typist I can pull more than 40 words a minute, but after seeing [Scott Hansleman's numbers](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/default.aspx?date=2004-09-20)&nbsp_place_holder;(100 WPM at his peak), I decided I needed to do better. I'm crossing the 30 WPM mark in Mavis, and when I get close to 40, I'll switch full time. We'll see how it goes.

I wonder how many professional developers actually touch type? Do you? Do your co-workers?

  * [Music Plasma](http://www.musicplasma.com/) - This is very cool. Apparently it uses the Amazon "people who also bought" statistics to show you how bands are related to one another. Very cool. [via [Craig Andera](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2004/11/09/3351.aspx)]
  * [Warning Stickers on Bibles](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/10/story_on_cobb_county.html) - This is an interesting take on the creationism warning sticker debate. I suppose we will end up with warning stickers on everything at some point.
  * [CAPTCHA ASP.NET Control](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000094.html) - An server control that gives you those "type the letters from the image" tools to stop automated form submissions. [via [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=99b2e3e9-5597-4883-a015-d77c3246a2a8)]
  * [Interactive Wallpaper](http://www.interaction-ivrea.it/en/gallery/notsowhitewalls/index.asp) - [Brian Button](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/oneagilecoder/) just sent me this via IM and I had to blog it. Very cool.
