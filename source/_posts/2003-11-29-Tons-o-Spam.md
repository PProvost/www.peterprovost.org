Boy, I just don't know what I would do without [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/windows.html). I kinda forgot to check my personal email account for a week. (The address of which is plastered all over this site and has been on the spam lists for almost 10 years.) 

Needless to say, I got SPAMMED! 1281 junk mails. Wanna guess how many false positives [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/windows.html) messed up on? 

ZERO! 

How about how many messages went unfiltered? 

SIX! 

Out of 1281 spam messages, only 6 were missed by [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/windows.html). That is a miss rate of less than 0.4%. Fucking sweet.
