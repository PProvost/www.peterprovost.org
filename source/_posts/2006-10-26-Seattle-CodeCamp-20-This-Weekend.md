If you are going to be in or near Redmond this weekend, I suggest you check out the Seattle CodeCamp that will be going on.

One important change that I just found out about: **the venue has changed!!**

> **IMPORTANT -- Venue Change!**

Due to an unexpected turn of events, the location for Seattle Code Camp v2.0 has changed. We are now holding Code Camp at the DigiPen Institute of Technology, which is located at:

> 5001 NE 150th Ave  
Redmond, WA 98052 [map] 
> 
> A huge thank you to the folks at DigiPen for opening up their doors to us on such short notice. See you at Camp in Redmond!

I think this is across the highway from Microsoft, halfway between main campus and "Red-West" on 50th.

Also, the [schedule/agenda](http://seattle.techevents.info/codecamp/2/agenda.aspx) has been posted.

Hope to see you there!
