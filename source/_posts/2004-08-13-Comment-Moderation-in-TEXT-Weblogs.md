It sounds like [the new comment moderation feature in .TEXT is annoying some weblogs.asp.net users](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericgu/archive/2004/08/13/214146.aspx). If what I hear is correct, that doesn't surprise me much.

I've been thinking about this a bit, and I wonder if ScottW's approach is in need of some work. I like the idea of comment moderation, but I think maybe there needs to be a better way to do it.

Having the blog owner "allow" every comment will get tedious. Especially for those bloggers who have lots of comments (like ericgu). How about a scheme where the blogger can "Allow comments from UserX."

The problem with that approach is that for people to post comments that are "premoderated" they have to register with the blog and probably create a password or something. But honestly, that wouldn't be that bad. I would register with weblogs.asp.net once and then all of the blogs there have the option of allowing me to have unmoderated comments.

This is how some of the mailing lists work and it seems to work well. When someone new posts you have to moderate them, but after a second good post, you open the door for them as an individual and you don't have to deal with it anymore.

Or we could try something with public key/private keys or certificates, but I suspect that would be beyond the capabilities of non-tech users.

Thoughts?
