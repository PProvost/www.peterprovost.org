Wow. This is an interesting looking application. I haven't done more than read parts of the site and look at the screenshots, but it sure looks interesting.

You create a model, which is basically beams and either hinge or slider joints. Then you assign motion to the joints (e.g. sine, step, etc.) and let 'er rip.

I think I'll probably blow an hour or two this weekend playing around with this.
