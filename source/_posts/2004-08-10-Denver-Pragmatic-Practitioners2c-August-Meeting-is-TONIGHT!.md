Oops. With all the other crap in my life, I completely forgot to post this...

**Date:  
**Tuesday, August 10, 2004 5:30 PM-8:00 PM

**Location:** ([map](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&address=98+Inverness+Drive+East+Suite+150+&city=Englewood&state=CO&zipcode=80112))  
Interlink Group Offices  
2nd Floor Conference Room  
98 Inverness Drive East, Suite 150  
Englewood CO 80112 

**Topic:**  
Security vs. Agility

We all know security is important. It's a process, not a product. But when faced with mantras about doing the simplest thing possible, how do you end up with an architecture that is both secure and malleable?

Can you, in a nutshell, be secure and agile?

The Denver Pragmatic Practitioners take an informal approach to meeting. We prefer conversations over pizza and beer, so come ready to make some new friends and have a great chat about interviewing! Refreshments will be provided.

We look forward to seeing you there!
