Topic: Source Control Systems - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

Most people have had experience with a number of difference source control systems during their careers. Often these experiences have been good, but just as often they have been bad. Join the Denver Pragmatic Practitioners for a round-table discussion with your peers about what has worked and hasn't worked.

If the door is locked when you get here, please call 303-542-7180 and someone will come let you in.

We look forward to seeing you there.
