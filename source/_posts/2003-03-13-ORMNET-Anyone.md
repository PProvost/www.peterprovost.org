I recently [made a few comments](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/02/23.html#a32) about how [Deklarit](http://www.deklarit.com) didn't really work out for me. It was followed up by an email from someone at Deklarit asking why.

DataSets are all well and good, but I don't like to them beyond the my DAL. They give me nice access to the table structure, but once I get beyond that, I really prefer to use classes that have a structure more like the domain model.

Today I found [ORM.NET](http://www.olero.com/Ormweb/). This looks to me like it is more what I was looking for. We'll see. I'll give it a try and see what I think. Has anyone else out there played with this?
