Today I uploaded the code for the tools needed to convert from a [dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net/) weblog to a [.Text](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/dottext) weblog. After multiple requests for the code and a number of submitted changes/bugfixes, I decided the best way to handle it was to make it open source.

The project is on [SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/) at the following URL:

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblog2dottext/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblog2dottext/)

[Craig Andera](http://www.pluralsight.com/craig/default.aspx) has graciously offered to help me admin the project and he will be checking in some updates in the next couple of days.

I also want to that all of the people who submitted updates and fixes to the code. Although I don't expect to need this tool ever again, hopefully we can all work together to make it better for those who need it.
