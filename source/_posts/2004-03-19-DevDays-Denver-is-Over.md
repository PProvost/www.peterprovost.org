Whew. That was fun. I think my talk on "Threats and Threat Modeling" went well. I had a few people come up to me and tell me that this was the best DevDays they'd been to, so that was a good sign. 

The Whidbey demos were straight out of the PDC, so nothing much new there. The Smart Client track had a suprisingly full room. From what I'd heard about the other cities, most people were skipping that in favor of Web Security. 

I hope anyone who attended had a good time. If you attended my session and have any questions or comments, please contact me or leave a comment on this post. 

Thanks!
