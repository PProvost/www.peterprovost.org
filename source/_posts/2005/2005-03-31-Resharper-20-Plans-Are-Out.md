I know I've mentioned it before, but I am hooked on ReSharper. Not having it inside of Visual Studio 2005 is killing me (and a few others around here).

But yesterday, the folks at JetBrains posted the [ReSharper 2.0 Plan](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+2.0+Plan).

Highlights:

  * Support of Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2003 
  * Support of C# 2.0 (under Visual Studio 2005 only) 
  * Support of VB.NET (refactorings, usage search, navigation, code formatter) 
  * Support of ASP.NET (almost all features implemented for C# and VB.NET for code inside ASP pages) 
  * Cross-language refactoring 
  * Open API (plug-ins support) 
  * Loading in background
  * New preprocessor directives handling (no errors caused by use of preprocessor directives anymore!) 
  * New Refactorings
  * On-the-fly Code Highlighting
  * "Create file from Live Template" feature 
  * File structure view with regions, drag&drop etc 

Bring it on! I'm ready.
