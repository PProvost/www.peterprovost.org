I don't know how Scott finds the time to keep up with all this stuff. I will admit that I either use or have used 75% of the stuff on this list, though, so it is nice to have this page when I need to find something quickly.

Too bad the URL isn't easier to remember. Scott.. you listening? ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile3.gif)

UPDATE 2005-07-15: [Scott was listening](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BetterUrlForTheUltimateToolsList.aspx) and I have updated the long line-wrapping link that used to be on this page with the nice one that is now there.
