If you are attending PDC this year, please go vote for the Birds of Feather
sessions you would like to see happen. Here is a summary from the submission
page: 

> A "Birds of a Feather" session is a one-hour open, moderated discussion on a
> topic of interest to the Microsoft PDC05 conference attendees. Anyone
> attending the conference (except Microsoft employees) is eligible to propose
> a topic using the submission form below. You are encouraged to vote for the
> topics that you'd most like to see at the conference. 

Here are the seven I voted for... go pick yours today! 

  * Agile vs. Non-agile Development 
  * Extensibility Architectures for Applications 
  * Future of the Deep Coder 
  * Help! I Have To Manage Programmers! 
  * Team Development with NTeam 
  * Using Enterprise Library in the Real World 
  * Visual Studio 2005 Team System -- Blessing or Anathema? 

TSHAK is moderating the EntLib talk, and he was on the team with us for the
v1.0 release so you know it will be a good chat. I thought the rest looked
pretty interesting too. Go vote:
