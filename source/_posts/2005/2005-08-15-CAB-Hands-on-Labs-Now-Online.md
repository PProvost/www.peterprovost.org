Many thanks to all the people who showed up for the CAB webcast last week. Ron Jacobs went through the first couple of labs from the CAB Hands on Labs while Brad, Ed and myself joked and heckled from the sidelines. It was a blast to do. 

Now you can play along on your own computer! [The CAB Hands on Labs are now up on our GDN Workspace](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c). There really is no better way to learn than with labs like these, so go check 'em out.
