As I've said before, I hate getting sick. I got a case of the stomach flu from one of my kids this week and it beat me down pretty good. But I'm back nowΓÇª

  * [Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 RTM](http://blogs.msdn.com/bowerm/archive/2005/04/15/408450.aspx) - Yep it happened. We've been enjoying these new bits all week and they are pretty darn good. Still a few interesting bugs that you will have to work around, but things are pretty good from what I can see. It will be up on MSDN Subscriber Downloads shortly.
  * [Google Sightseeing](http://www.shreddies.org/gmaps/) - A cool new blog that shows off some of the more interesting satellite photos people have found on Google Maps. [thanks to [AaronX](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/) for sending this one in]
  * [More FxCop Rules for EntLib](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/tshak/archive/2005/04/12/65389.aspx) - TShak is at it again, this time with one for making sure you use byte[] instead of string with Crypto functions and another making sure you dispose your Tracer classes in the right order.
  * [Alternative Greeking](http://www.duckisland.com/GreekMachine.asp) - Greeking is that "Lorem ipsum" dummy text that designers use when doing mock-ups. But pseudo-greek is boring, so why not use Hillbilly? [via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/11/alternative_to_lorem.html)]
  * [AJAX Wrapper for .NET](http://weblogs.asp.net/mschwarz/archive/2005/04/07/397504.aspx) - Looks interesting. I've been wanting to try something like this for a while but haven't had time.
  * [![Accurate_with_Kid](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/Accurate_with_Kid.gif)StorTroopers Avatars](http://www.stortroopers.com/) - I love silly avatar generators. I've got a whole bunch of them that I use for MSN Messenger. One thing that I always try to do is create one that best represents what I think I look like. I created the one you see here using the this engine. What do you think? [via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/10/tiny_witty_pixellate.html)]
  * [MSN Messenger 7.0](http://messenger.msn.com/) - The new version of MSN Messenger is out and while I like some of the new features (tag lines), I have to wonder what the UI design team was smoking. You think they could have packed any more crap in there? (Turn off the tabs and the mini-personal-icons and it cleans up a bit.)
  * [What is a Breaking Change?](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2005/04/09/406753.aspx) - Brad Abrams points to an article on MS Downloads that helps to explain this challenging problem.
  * [Pseudo Internationalization](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,dd0e44ac-01bb-4c6e-8f7b-5b845e3bfcab.aspx) - Scott Hanselman points to an article and tool for creating resource files that look like localized ones for testing your I18N stuff. He also tweaked it a bit to work better in Continuous Integration settings.
