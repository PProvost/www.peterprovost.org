For those of you who are going to PDC and staying until the end, please come by
the **Advances in Agile Development** panel on Friday. I was just invited to
sit on this panel and I'm really excited. 

**PNL01 - Advances in Agile Development**

The pressure for application development teams to deliver more value to the
business has never been greater. No single methodology fits all project types,
yet it's critical to provide a common framework and taxonomy across projects
and teams. Come see how industry gurus and leading services organizations
discuss advances in using a combination of agile frameworks and methodologies,
like 'MSF for Agile Software Development' to deliver real business value by
helping development teams meet aggressive delivery schedules and achieve
better, faster, and cheaper results, while at the same time adapting to
changing business requirements.
