![5585926503747814](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/5585926503747814_small.jpg)A couple of days ago my iPod Shuffle arrived and I love it. My lovely wife [Emily](http://blogs.provost.org/Emily) got me one for my birthday.

As you can see from this picture, it is literally the size of a pack of gum. Tiny. I carry it in my front pocket with my chapstick and my [spacepen](http://www.spacepen.com/).

Why a shuffle you might ask? Well, I agree with [what Brad Wilson said](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/004280.shtml): there are two kinds of music listeners. Those who have tons of music and probably use shuffle play a lot, and those who have less music and tend to pick and choose specific albums or playlists. I used to be the latter, but for the past year or so I have definitely been in the former camp. So when I saw the shuffles were only $100, I decided I wanted one.

There are a couple of accessories that I'm on the lookout for:

  * A Key Chain Case - Something that will protect it from banging up against the keys but lets me use it as my key fob.
  * An FM Adapter - Yeah I know I can get any number of these, but they aren't designed to work with the shuffle and so I end up with wires all over the place. I'd like something that snaps on to it like the iTrip does for regular iPods.

UPDATE: My frield [PK](http://weblogs.ilg.com/PKleinschnitz/) just IMed me&nbsp_place_holder;and told me that [XtremeMac has exactly what I'm looking for](http://www.xtrememac.com/shopby/ipodtype/ipod_shuffle.shtml)&nbsp_place_holder;in their new iPod Shuffle line. Or, more correctly, they will have them by the end of March. It looks like the [SuperHook](http://www.xtrememac.com/ipodgear/superhook_shuffle.shtml) ($19.95) + [TuffWrapz](http://www.xtrememac.com/ipodgear/tuffwrapz.shtml) ($24.95) + [AirPlay for Shuffle](http://www.xtrememac.com/adapters/airplay_shuffle.shtml) ($49.95) will do exactly what I want. But that will end up costing as much as the Shuffle did. Hmmm. There has to be e better way. I suppose I could make the hook and get a cheaper FM adapter. HmmmΓÇª I think I'll wait a bit longer and see what happens in the marketplace.
