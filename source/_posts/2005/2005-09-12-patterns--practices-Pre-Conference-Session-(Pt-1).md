PDC is here. I'm sure you know that already, but it is really here. And I am here too. ![](/Files/smile1.gif)

I flew in yesterday afternoon, arrived just in time to grab dinner with [Vin](http://www.thearchitectexchange.com/asehmi/), [Beat](http://blogs.msdn.com/beatsch/), [Ron](http://www.ronjacobs.com/), [Don](http://dev4net.com/blog/), [DonXML](http://www.donxml.com/), and [Edgardo](http://geekswithblogs.net/evega/). We had Tapas at the restarant across the street from the Westin Bonaventure. It was great. 

After dinner everyone went back to their rooms but I decided to take a lap around the lobby bar to see who was there. I found [Scoble](http://scoble.weblogs.com/), [Jeff Key](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/) and a bunch of other very cool people from all over the world. Since I'm presenting as part of today's pre-con session, I probably should have gone to bed, but I didn't. Instead I spent time with customers and colleagues drinking [Guiness](http://www.guinness.com/gateway/default.aspx?Lang=en-us&BrandId=SO&RefUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.guinness.com%2fTemplates%2fRedirectToGateway.aspx%3fNRMODE%3dPublished%26NRORIGINALURL%3d%252f%26NRNODEGUID%3d%257b7892FE09-EC41-4F5B-A336-9EAC47569C2F%257d%26NRCACHEHINT%3dGuest). 

Mmmmm.... as they say in the old county: [Guiness is Good For You](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3266819.stm). (Maybe I should do [the Guiness diet](http://theguinnessdiet.blogspot.com/) this week? I think not.) 

This morning I was actually feeling fine, which is one of the reasons I drink the black stuff (no hangovers). I hooked up with Vin and Beat in the breakfast cafe and we headed over to the conference center for our pre-con session with Ron Jacobs. 

Which is where I am now. Sitting off to the right, watching Ron tell his stories. If you've seen Ron Jacobs talk before, then you know what I'm talking about. Ron has this amazing gift-of-the-gab kinda thing that leaves me in awe. I think I'm a pretty good speaker, but Ron really is amazing. He can tell a story about getting stopped at a border crossing into Canada and turn it into a discussion about [Service Orientation Tenet #1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/soa/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/srorientwp.asp). Amazing. 

But I have to rewind a bit. Because one of the funniest things happened in the 15 minutes leading up to the start of the session. 

First of all, Ron is dressed in a suit. Not the traditional (required) blue Microsoft speakers shirt. A suit. 

Ron: "I was there when Don Box gave his presentation in the nude and I decided that I needed to do something to make me stand out. No other speakers will be wearing a suit, right?"

But that still isn't the funniest part. 

Ron: "I got this suit the last time I was in Bankok. Isn't it nice?"

Some people wouldn't brag about their Bangkok suit. But Ron does. But this still isn't the funny part. 

Let me set this up with a bit of role-playing. You are attending the pre-con, wandering around the conference center looking for the patterns & practices pre-con session. The conference center is huge and you're dazzled by the signs and monitors and videos and food and drinks and famous people and all that. 

Then you round the corner and see a sign that tells you you've arrived at your destination. You open the door and walk into... 

**The Phil Donahue Show Hosted By Ron Jacobs**

There is Ron, in his suit, walking up to you with an outstretched microphone... 

"What's your name?"

"Did you have a good weekend?"

"Where are you from?"

"What is that cool little gadget in your pocket?"

"What would you like to learn today?"

"Do you like my new suit? I got it in Bangkok..."

_To be continued..._
