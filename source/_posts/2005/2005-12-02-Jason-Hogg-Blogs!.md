I just wanted to let everyone know that our resident Web Services and Security guy, [Jason Hogg](http://blogs.msdn.com/thehoggblog/), has started blogging.

He's started out with a three part post titled, "Introduction, Integration and Securing Web Services" ([Part 1](http://blogs.msdn.com/thehoggblog/archive/2005/11/19/494918.aspx), [Part 2](http://blogs.msdn.com/thehoggblog/archive/2005/11/22/495767.aspx), [Part 3](http://blogs.msdn.com/thehoggblog/archive/2005/11/30/498377.aspx)) that lays out the roadmap for his upcoming work. Must read if you do anything in the integration/web-services space.
