[Eugenio Pace](http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/default.aspx), the Product Manager for the [p&p](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/) Smart Client program just [posted this to his blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2005/08/11/450718.aspx)...

> For those thinking about moving forward those VB6 applications to the .NET platform, but have doubts where to start or how; or simply need some help in estimating the effort of such project, check this [new guide](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/projects/vb62vbnet) from patterns & practices.
> 
> Published in this community site you will be able to download a draft of the guide (almost 14 chapters); and the team will be publishing additional content as it becomes available (like the assessment tool to estimate effort and perform an analysis of the code you need to migrate).
> 
> The Guide covers many technical challenges (like COM+, unsupported featues, API call, etc.) but also addresses the process of migration: asessment, planning and effort estimation, preparation for migration, application advancement, etc. 
> 
> Experience has shown us that an appropriate assessment and preparation of an application prior to running the upgrade wizard inreases the success or the "efficiency" of the tool very significantly.
> 
> As any other offering from patterns & practices, this guide is being built with heavy input from real experience, so if you have something to tell us, please do! Send us an e-mail to vbmigfb AT microsoft.com
> 
> Thanks!
