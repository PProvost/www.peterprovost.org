The founder of "Gonzo Journalism" is dead after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

I still remember first running across [Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679785892/peterprovosto-20) as a teenager and being completely overwhelmed by it. It was like no other book I had ever seen. Later, as my reading list expanded, I recognized influences like [Kerouac](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&tag=peterprovosto-20&keyword=Kerouac&index=books), [Bukowski](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&tag=peterprovosto-20&keyword=Bukowski&index=books)&nbsp_place_holder;and [Mencken](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&tag=peterprovosto-20&keyword=Mencken&index=books) in what Thomson had done.

Like it or hate it, his writing was like no other.
