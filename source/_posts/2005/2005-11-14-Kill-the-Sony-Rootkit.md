Jason Garms [posted this](http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/archive/2005/11/12/414299.aspx) to the [Anti-Malware Engineering Team Blog](http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/default.aspx):

> We have analyzed this software, and have determined that in order to help protect our customers we will add a detection and removal signature for the rootkit component of the XCP software to the Windows AntiSpyware beta, which is currently used by millions of users. This signature will be available to current beta users through the normal Windows AntiSpyware beta signature update process, which has been providing weekly signature updates for almost a year now. Detection and removal of this rootkit component will also appear in Windows Defender when its first public beta is available. We also plan to include this signature in the December monthly update to the Malicious Software Removal Tool. It will also be included in the signature set for the online scanner on Windows Live Safety Center. 

Excellent news! Get that crap off your machine! In the meantime, [make sure you are running as a non-admin](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/category/5785.aspx) and that you [turn off AutoPlay for CDs](http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article03-018) before you insert **_any_** CDs in your computer.
