OK folks. People have been all over [Scott Densmore](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore), emailing him, pinging him on IM. We've seen posts on mailing lists both internal and external asking where it is. Scott even got contacted by a guy in Holland who was gonna stay up all night if that's what it took.

At least we didn't have [people camping out for weeks](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/27/journal_of_a_camping.html) waiting for it, eh?

I promised I would let Scott post first (and I did--his post is [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2005/01/28/362811.aspx)), but now that that is all out of the wayΓÇª

Enterprise Library 1.0 Is Now Available!!

You can [download it from MSDN now](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib.asp). There have been discussions of setting up an EntLib team blog for us to share tips and tricks, but that hasn't happened yet. I'll let you know if it does.
