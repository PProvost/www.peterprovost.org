We all totally forgot to blog about this before it happened, but we can at least point you to the recorded version of the talk. Here's the abstract: 

> Join this patterns & practices webcast with the Enterprise Library development team to learn about their experiences doing agile development in a collaborative forum. Experts will share lessons learned, what works best, and what not to do. Hear how patterns & practices distributed teams work with contributors all over the world and the techniques they found most effective for staying together as an agile team. 

[Brad Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy), [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder), [Darrell Snow](http://blogs.msdn.com/darrellsnow) and I got together and gave an "agile talk on agility" where even though we had a slide deck of candidate topics, we bounced around instead, answering questions from the audience. It was a very fun talk for us to give and hopefully it was valuable to our audience.
