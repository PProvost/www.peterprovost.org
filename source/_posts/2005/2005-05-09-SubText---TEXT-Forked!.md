I've been wondering how long this was gonna take to happen. Like many others, I didn't jump on the Community Server Bandwagon. .TEXT was a good engine. It was BSD licensed. All was well.

Community Server is a commercial product.

As Phil Haack says:

> Another reason is that Community Server has become sort of the Team System of blogging engines. By virtue of it going commercial, it's being targetted to a different market than your average hobbyist and blogger. While I'm sure many are looking forward to the tight integration with forums and photo gallery, that's just not something I personally need. 

So Phil and a few others have forked the project into a new one called [SubText](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/2953.aspx). (Great name, btw.) They are running the project over on SourceForge - [http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext/).

Congrats guys!

Maybe now someone will rewrite the templating engine. I detest the way it works now. Too many damn files and user controls to make a skin. It just isn't that hard. 

Or maybe I will. Hmmmm. We'll see.
