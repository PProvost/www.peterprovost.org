Wow. It's been almost a month since I last posted a Geek Notes. A lot has happened around here. We went to Denver for Thanksgiving. My team shipped the Composite User Interface Application Block. I moved the blog to a new server. And who can believe that it is December already?

  * [MSBuild Community Tasks Project](http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/) - This is probably the most exciting community thing I've seen in a little while. MSBuild is amazingly powerful and until now, the only library of tasks that I had found was the SDC Tasks produced by Microsoft UK. This looks like a great little project and I hope they do well.
  * [Disable Caps Lock](http://johnhaller.com/jh/useful_stuff/disable_caps_lock/) - I thought I'd blogged this already, but apparently I forgot. I hate the caps lock key and after my most recent repave, I forgot to remap the damn thing into&nbsp_place_holder;a Control key.
  * [parse-textObject](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/parsetextObjectAWKWithAVengeance.aspx) - Lee Holmes has posted this amazing AWK-like MSH script for parsing and manipulating strings. But my favorite part is not so much the script, but that he also shows his unit testing harness. I may have to see what kind of TDD support I can spin up for MSH scripts.
  * [Snippy](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=b0813ae7-466a-43c2-b2ad-f87e4ee6bc39) - [Darren May found this cool little client app](http://weblogs.ilg.com/DarenM/archive/2005/11/16/2370.aspx#comment) for creating VS2005 code snippets. And to think I've been doing them by hand all this timeΓÇª ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile1.gif)
  * [Free Email Hosting at Live.com](http://domains.live.com/) - Do you already own your own domain name? domains.live.com will host your email and let you access it through hotmail. For free. Pretty cool. If you want more services, I think they're planning to offer a paid version too.

  * [Real TDD with VSTS](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/archive/2005/11/28/9859.aspx) - My good friend Brian Button wrote a nice piece about the right way and the wrong way to do TDD in VSTS. Must read.
