I'm back. Been busy as hell since&nbsp_place_holder;[we got back from Mexico](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/02/18/2886.aspx)ΓÇª

  * [Ajax: A New Approach](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php) - Apparently there is now a name for XML+Javascript web applications like [GMail](http://gmail.com/) and [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/). BTW, if you haven't tried Google Maps yet, you need to stop right now and go check it out. Amazing.
  * [Getting Rid of WebForms](http://mikeroberts.thoughtworks.net/blog/archive/Tech/dotNet/GoodbyeWebForms.html) - Brad Wilson wrote about this idea a long time ago and now it looks like they've done it for CruiseControl.NET too.
  * [Automobile Virus](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/automobile_viru_1.html) - It had to happen. Soon we will have viruses for everything we own. Oh the wonderful world of connected devices.
  * [Process Explorer 9.0](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml) - This must have too from sysinternals revved lately. Go get it. 
  * [XSLTO](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/02/09/5688.aspx) - Wow. This is a much friendlier way to do XSLT - in C#. I'm with Craig on this oneΓÇª less XML-as-a-programming-language.
  * [More Presentation Tips](http://www.venkatarangan.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=dab57735-2976-40d7-a5d0-2e641ddea515) - I've always referred people to [Scott Hanselman's presentation tips](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/01/22/scottHanselmansTipsForASuccessfulMsftPresentati), but when Scott starts [referring people to this list](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,afd3ad3c-9949-427c-8692-3a444b26b380.aspx), you gotta take a look.
  * [Building Your Own Windows MCE Home Theatre System](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,ed7005d8-8927-4853-9f58-362983428553.aspx) - From scratch for about $1500. HmmmΓÇª I love my TiVo, but when I finally decide to give up on it, I think I'll build something like this.
  * [Help Beatallica](http://www.petitiononline.com/p1gp0g/petition.html) - From Craig Andera's [post](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/02/18/5999.aspx): "ΓÇªthey need your help. They're being sued by the a-holes at Sony for copyright infringement of The Beatles work, despite the fact that they're doing parodies, which is legal."
