&nbsp_place_holder;This morning before coming to work, Emily and&nbsp_place_holder;I made French toast with our (almost) three year old daughter, Hadley. After breakfast she said, "Mommy, I want to play 'puter 'dames."

Now, this isn't a new thing for her. She has become very good at the games on Noggin.com, MyLittlePony.com, Barbie.com and NickJr.com. Every day she spends some time playing these games. 

(Emily and I have really learned to hate some of the soundtracks on those gamesΓÇª but I digressΓÇª)

This morning something changed. This morning she said, "Daddy, I want to have my own 'puter in my room some day."

Whoa. She's only three and she already wants her own computer.

So here are a few&nbsp_place_holder;questions for any techie dads who read this blog. How do you handle your kids having their own computers? PC or Mac? At what age did you let them have their own computer? Did you lock it down? How? Do you monitor their surfing? How? I've been told that MSN actually has great parental controls, but I haven't used it myself.
