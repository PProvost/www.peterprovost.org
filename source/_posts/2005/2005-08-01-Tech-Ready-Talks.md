Today I helped [Ron Jacobs](http://www.ronjacobs.com/) and [Eugenio Pace](http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/) with their presentations at Tech Ready. Tech Ready is the annual internal conference for technical field people to learn about all the new stuff going on in Redmond and I was cool to be asked to help out. The first session was with Ron called Patterns & Practices Survival. Ron and I talked about all of the cool things PAG is doing now and in the coming year. Ron is a great speaker and it was fun to be up there with him. He then asked me to help out with his Enterprise Library talk. I then closed up the day facilitating the CAB instructor led labs. All the session were well attended and seemed to be well received. The CAB Lab was full in fact and we have another session in the morning. (I'm not looking forward to the commute to Seattle at 8am, but you gotta do what you gotta do.)
