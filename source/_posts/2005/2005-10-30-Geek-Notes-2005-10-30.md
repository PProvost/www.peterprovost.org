This week I have become the [WiX](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/) MVP in p&p&nbsp_place_holder;![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile1.gif). You see, I decided to completely rewrite the WiX installer we've been using for [CAB](http://codegallery.gotdotnet.com/cab), trying to make a more general purpose installer that can be used by all of our projects moving forward. I've learned more than I ever wanted about MSI and WiX, but I've almost got something that does what I want.

  * [WiX Tutorial](http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/) - If you're gonna do WiX, you have to start here. This is an excellent introduction to building a nice MSI using WiX. Another good reason to bookmark this page is his [Takeoff Checklist](http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/checklist.html) that you should run through before shipping your MSI.
  * [List of Fictional Expletives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_curse_words) - This is a great page on wikipedia. Fake swearwords from across the fiction universe. 
  * [Guided Tour of MSH](http://arstechnica.com/guides/other/msh.ars) - ars technica has resently published a nice walkthru of the Microsoft Command Shell (aka Monad aka MSH).
  * [OpenOffice Bloated?](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=120) - This is an interesting analysis that compares OpenOffice to Microsoft Office. "It doesn't matter how fast the CPU isΓÇª OpenOffice is simply bloated."
  * [Begone Boolean Parameters!](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2005/10/26/475085.aspx) - I've been saying this for a long time nowΓÇª boolean parameters are confusing and should be replaced with easy to understand enumerations. Now Mr. Abrams has said it, so perhaps more people will listen.
  * [Photoshop-ish Keyboard Shortcuts for The Gimp 2.2](http://epierce.freeshell.org/gimp/gimp_ps.php) - I've used [The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) for years as a free replacement for Photoshop. Works pretty well, and you can't beat the price. But I always hated the keyboard shortcuts. These will make it feel much more like Photoshop.
