Wow. I was asking to go to PDC this year and didn't expect it. Generally the
people who get to go are Program Managers, Product Managers and Architects...
not us lowly Software Development Engineers. ![](/Files/smile1.gif)

But apparently my argument that a group that creates guidance for developers
should probably send a developer to the Microsoft developer conference. I'm not
sure what talks I'll be participating in, but I'm sure I will be a part of the
_patterns & practices_ pre-con session. Hope to see you all there.
