Back in October, [Brad Wilson and I talked at Code
Camp](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/10/21/8861.aspx) about
a way of doing TDD and Pair-Programming that I have blogged about: [The TDD
Pair-Programming
Game](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/08/29/7377.aspx).

We have now been invited to do another presentation of that as an MSDN webcast:

> **[MSDN Architecture Webcast: Play the Test-Driven Development Pairing Game
> (Level
> 200)](https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032287654)**
> 
> Start Time:   Thursday, January 05, 2006 11:00 AM (GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)    
> End Time:   Thursday, January 05, 2006 12:00 PM (GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)  
> 
> Event Description    
> Products: .NET Framework.   
> Recommended Audience: Architect.   
> Language: English-American 
> 
> Description:   Have you tried test-driven
> development? What about pair-programming? These two practices are often
> misunderstood by developers who are just starting to explore agile software
> development. This webcast introduces a new technique called "The TDD
> Pair-Programming Game," which integrates these two practices. Learn how this
> approach can help you write better software and have more fun doing it.
> 
> Presenters: Peter Provost, Software Design Engineer & Brad Wilson, Software
> Development Engineer, Microsoft Corporation

Please join us, it will be fun.
