Ron Jacobs, Brad Wilson and myself will be hosting a CAB Webcast this Thursday the 11th. at 10:30 am (PST, GMT -8) 

Don't miss this opportunity to understand the block's goals and architecture with the team members that are building it. We are planning to do some of the soon-to-be released Hands on Labs, so come check it out.
