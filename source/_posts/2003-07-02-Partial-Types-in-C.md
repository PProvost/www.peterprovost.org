Rather than hide generated code using #region directives, generated code can simply live in an external file that can be managed by the IDE. Developers can write code without ever having to see the generated code, which should make it harder for folks to inadvertently modify tool-generated code.

I hadn't considered this, and honestly this worries me. It reminds me of the days where developers would slap together applications and not understand any of the code generated by their Wizards. Don't get me wrong, I love code-generation tools, but I don't like the idea of hiding the generated code from the developer. It is very important that each programmer know what the code in his application says.
