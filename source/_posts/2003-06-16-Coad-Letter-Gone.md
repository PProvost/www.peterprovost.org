So is Peter Coad still doing the Coad Letter mailing list? I've been subscribed for a while but haven't seen any in a few months. When I Googled "Coad Letter" what I found caught me by surprise. Peter has been acquired by Borland:

> At Borland, it is our pleasure to welcome Peter Coad as our Chief Executive Strategist and SVP, one of four execs who report directly to Dale Fuller, CEO. Randy Miller, co-author of Advanced Use Case Modeling and A Practical Guide to Extreme Programming, is the Editor-in-Chief. [From [http://bdn.borland.com/coadletter/](http://bdn.borland.com/coadletter/)]

I don't know if it has always been this way or if it is new, but it looks like he doesn't have time to get his newsletter out. Too bad, I always enjoyed it.
