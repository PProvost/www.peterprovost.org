After that last post, I decided to dig a little bit to see if perhaps I wasn't using the plug-in properly. Apparently I'm not, but I did discover [another .TEXT plug-in](http://blogs.biasecurities.com/jim/archive/2004/01/06/271.aspx) written by James Geurts that supports them. I just installed it and hopefully this post will demonstrate that it works properly.

UPDATE: It works! Yippee!
