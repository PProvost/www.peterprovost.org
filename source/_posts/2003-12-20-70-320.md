Yesterday afternoon I took Microsoft Cert test 70-320 "[Developing XML Web Services and Server Components with Microsoft Visual C# .NET and the Microsoft .NET Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-320.asp)". Passed with flying colors. It was a different test than I expected, but I had been given some warning by a coworker. From the title, you would expect 50% Web Services and 50% Enterprise Services. 

Those two things are certainly covered on the test, but the are joined by a large amount of .NET Remoting and SQL Server. All of the tests I've taken so far in the MCSD.NET├é track have had fair amounts of database stuff, but this one had a lot more than I expected. 

So if you are thinking about taking this test, I would suggest you spend some time reviewing [Code Clinic's Review Guide](http://www.codeclinic.com/70-320skills.htm). It is basically a big collection of MSDN links for the related sections. Another excellent resource is [MCSE Braindumps](http://www.mcsebraindumps.com/), but that is more of a "memorize it and hope" resource instead of a "learn it and know it" resource.
