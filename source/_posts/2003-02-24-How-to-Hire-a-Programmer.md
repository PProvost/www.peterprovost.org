[This article](http://www.artima.com/wbc/interprog.html)&nbsp_place_holder;by Chris Sells looks interesting. I've had to hire developers in the past, but now that I own my own shop I have to interview all of the developers we hire. I've used some, but not all, of the techniques that Chris discusses. Nice article.
