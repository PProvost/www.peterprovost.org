While digging around the JetBrains COnfluence site this evening, I ran across [this page](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Sneak+Preview+of+ReSharper+IDE?showAttachments=true#attachments) that has screenshots of the upcoming ReSharper IDE. Very cool!

I like the way they are formatting the XML comments on the fly in the editor. Very nice. Much nicer than having all that damn XML cluttering up your editor. I wonder if they have a friendly way of editing it as well. Probably.

I can't wait for an EAP on this product. Hopefully I'll at least get an EAP on ReSharper 2.0 for Whidbey soon. I'm dying without it.
