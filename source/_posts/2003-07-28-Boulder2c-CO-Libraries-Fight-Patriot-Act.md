Nice job!

I just saw on 9-News that Boulder libraries have decided to fight the patriot act. They hope to prevent the federal government from coming to them and asking questions like "Who checked out the Anarchist's Cookbook lately?"

How? By not keeping records. Apparently they aren't going to keep any historical records of books that are checked in or out. Sounds good to me.

+1 for Boulder.
