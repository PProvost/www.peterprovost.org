Another day, [another blizzard](http://www.9news.com/storyfull.aspx?storyid=22046). Not too much snow so far, in terms of quantity, but it is blowing and sticking which makes driving a nightmare. My morning meeting was rescheduled, which is not surprising, and we may end up rescheduling the Denver Pragmatic Practitioners meeting too... I'll post soon as I've decided. 

  * [Rotor V2](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/joelpob/permalink.aspx/7c0634f2-7bcb-4071-9fea-b80099a06cb8) - It is official. We can expect another rev of Rotor that is based on the Whidbey source. Good stuff. I'm glad MS isn't ignoring this important project.
  * [SMTP Authentication using System.Web.Mail](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/SystemWeb_Mail_SMTP_AUTH.asp) - This Code Project article shows some cool techniques you can use to make the built-in mail system do things you didn't think were possible.
  * [Sound in VPC w/ Windows Server 2K3](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/004004.shtml) - Brad Wilson shows you how to do it... sort of.
  * [Geek Tattoos](http://www.bmezine.com/tattoo/geek001.html) - Wow. Some very cool tats in here... Quake, Mac, Barcodes, Binary, Hexadecimal...
  * [RSS 2.0 Framework](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/rssframework.asp) - Jerry Maguire posted his RSS framework for producing or consuming RSS feeds in C#. An alternative framework is [RSS.NET](http://rss-net.sourceforge.net/).
  * [Relax NG Now a Full ISO Standard](http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2119) - Wow. I hadn't heard that this was even coming. RNG is an alternative XML schema language that many feel is superior to XSD because of its simplicity.
