A week or so ago, [Rory Blythe](http://www.neopoleon.com/)&nbsp_place_holder;from [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) came by for a visit and an interview with me and [Ed Jezierski](http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez/). We had a great time during this interview and [it is now up](http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=276005)&nbsp_place_holder;for your enjoyment (or torture... YMMV). 

Enjoy!
