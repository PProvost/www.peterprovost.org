Members of the CAB team have started posting about specific things you will want to know if you are migrating&nbsp_place_holder;your code from the June 30 CAB CTP to the new October 2005 CTP that we released on Friday. Here's a list of what's up there so far. I'll come back and update this page when anyone posts any other useful migration information, so keep checking back.
