Well I made it through another Perry Rocks. I was not one of the crazy fools riding toboggans down steep hills and cliffs, but I was one of the crazy fools standing at the bottom with a camera. I'll post a pic or two soon. As far as I know, no one was seriously injured, but I'm sure a number of people are hobbling around carefully today.

Got my nose back to the grindstone today finishing up a distributed .NET Smart Client / Web Client application for a customer. Fun stuff. Smart Clients are cool.
