Have you ever wanted to reuse the XSL file that Internet Explorer uses to render XML? You used to be able to download it from MSDN, but apparently that link doesn't work anymore.

After much digging, I finally found someone who had it posted and so I don't lose it, I've posted it here.

UPDATE: If you are going to use this from .NET, you will need an XSLT 1.0 compliant version of that. After more digging, I found one done by Steve Muench. Here it is:
