I'm looking for an add-in for Visual Studio 2005. Or not. I guess I don't need it to be an addin, if it ran against a C# source file, that would be fine.

Here's what it would doΓÇª

  1. I launch the tool on a file and it presents a dialog that looks something like this  
  
![ClassOrganizer](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/ClassOrganizer.png)  

  2. Once I have the parts organized the way I like them, it organizes my class file as indicated, and sorts the items in each section alphabetically.

That's it! I can't believe no one has written this already. If I can't find one soon, I'll have to write it myself.
