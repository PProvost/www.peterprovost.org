OK, so I'm running Office 2003 beta and I've had plenty to say about Outlook. Generally, I like it but the spam is killing me. I traded email with Mark Hammond (author of the [SpamBayes Outlook Addin](http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/spambayes/)) and there will be a new version out soon that should work with Outlook 2003. Thank god.

But that isn't what this post is about. Back on May 20, [I posted a comment](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/05/20.html#a342) about the need for a design guideline about how programs minimize to the system tray. Now its getting worse. I have two programs (Outlook and Gnucleus) that use "minimize to the system tray". I have two different programs (Windows Messenger and Groove) that use "close to the system tray".

This is stupid. Two programs from Microsoft that use completely different methods. I'm always closing programs that expect to be minimized and minimizing programs that expect to be close. Aargh!
