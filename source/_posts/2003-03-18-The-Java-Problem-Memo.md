Wow. I love collecting quotes from Java people talking about why Java doesn't work out well, but [this one](http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1321) might take the cake. They are primarily talking about specific implementation details on Solaris, but to hear this kind of thing from Sun engineers is interesting.
