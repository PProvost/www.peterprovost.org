OK. Maybe I wasn't fair. Let's see...

After visiting the [Wintellect Instructor Bios Page](http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/), I found the following people. Then I used the [RD Search page](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Public/rdFind.aspx) and the [MVP list](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=toc) to see what I would find.

Name RD? MVP? Location

Jeff Prosise
No
Yes
USA

John Robbins
No
Yes
NH, USA

Jeffrey Richter
No
Yes
WA, USA

Francesco Balena
Yes
No
Italy

Dino Esposito
No
No

Kenn Scribner

OH, USA

John Lam

Jason Clark

Brent Rector

Yes
CA, USA

Peter DeBetta
No
No
TX, USA

To me this is a completelt different picture from that painted by Thinktecture. First of all Thinktecture was founded by two RDs and has two others on staff. That is the whole company. Also, Germany and Austria taken together are smaller than the state of California and yet they have 4 RDs... two of whom are also MVPs. Wintellect has one RD and four MVPs.

I think I was fair.
