It's a strange thing. After you have TiVo for a while, you start to do weird things. My 1 year old daughter took her first steps and my wife pointed the TiVo remote at her and pressed the "Instant Replay" button. Didn't work.

I was driving down the road listening to NPR and my phone rang. I really wanted to hear the story, so I reached for the "Pause" button on my radio. Didn't work.

Sometimes I wish I could "Pause" my customers during meetings. Or use "Instant Replay" to confirm what I think they said. Doesn't work.

Too bad.
