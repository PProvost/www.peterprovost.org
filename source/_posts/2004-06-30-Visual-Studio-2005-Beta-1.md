It looks like Beta 1 is out, although you do have login with Passport so it may be limited. Not sure yet. You can try to download it from here:

[http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/Default.aspx](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/Default.aspx)

Mine is downloading now... we'll see how different it is from the May preview we got at TechEd.

They've also got downloadable betas of the new [Express Editions](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/default.aspx) of these products:

  * Visual Basic 
  * Visual C# 
  * Visual C++ 
  * Visual J# 
  * Visual Web Dev 
  * SQL Server

Now I'm not 100% sure of this, but I had heard that the Express versions will be Free once the Visual Studio ships. That would certainly be a nice way to get hobbyest and students working with the products without having to spend an arm and a leg.

UPDATE: As&nbsp_place_holder;a few comments have pointed out, it appears that the download isn't actually there yet. I'm sure it will be soon.
