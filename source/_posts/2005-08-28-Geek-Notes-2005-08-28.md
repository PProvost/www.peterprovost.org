Now that Finn is basically a full time walker and is starting to show that famous attitude that all of the Provost's seem to possess, we finally decided to turn his room into a real little boy's room. Out with the "guest room" furniture and in with the little boy stuff. We took a trip to Ikea yesterday to start scouting furniture and colors. I'm&nbsp_place_holder;sure Emily will be posting more details as we proceed.

Here are a few things that have been collecting in my "blog this" collection...

  * [Enterprise Library for .NET August CTP](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327) - Many congrats to the EntLib team. They've been busting their asses getting this ready for all of you. Enjoy!
  * [Monad Team Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/monad/) - Yes, I'm still hooked on Msh (aka Monad). Now the team has a shared blog so those who don't have their own spout can share the Monad goodness.
  * [Freedom Languages](http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/9003/) - An excellent philosophical article that compares "safety languages" with "freedon languages". A quote: "Freedom languages are those languages that put the individual programmer at the center of their philosophical world.&nbsp_place_holder; They work hard to remove any language constructs that reduce programmer freedom, and add the most powerful constructs available."
  * [OpenSpace](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpenSpace.html) - Martin Fowler explains some of the history and background of Open Space... a very cool 'agile' way of doing conferences and get-togethers.
  * [Cracking Software To Run Non-Admin](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/CrackingSoftwareToRunAsNonAdmin.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;- Lee Holmes does something I've always wanted to do... actually crack someone's binaries to fix their LUA stupidity. Yeah, it may be a violatio of the license agreement, but as far as I'm concerned it isn't being done for profit or to steal IP but to fix a bug.
  * [Mio GPS SmartPhone](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/25/mio_a701_exposed/) - Hmmm... I was thinking I was gonna wait for a Q-Phone, but I may have to get one of these instead. [via [Rory](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/15858.aspx)]
  * [OQO 01](http://www.oqo.com/)&nbsp_place_holder;- While browsing [the comments on Rory's Mio GPS Smartphone post](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/15858.aspx#feedback), I found someone talking about this... the smallest self-contained PC&nbsp_place_holder;ever built. Oooooh. I want one.
