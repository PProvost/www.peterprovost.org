A couple of days ago, Oleg Sych made a wonderful post about how to combine our UML Modeling tools with T4 text templating and our extension APIs to generate code within Visual Studio.

He covers the basics of the UML designers, showing how you can use custom profiles to annotate elements for your code generation scripts.

The example is very good: generating a SQL database create script for a data model described as a UML Class diagram. This is exactly how we envisioned this stuff being used and I'm very excited to see it happening so early, on Beta 2 bits.
