OK... I haven't actually tried it yet, 'cause I just found it, but this could be the best thing for C# developers since... well... C#!

[This free tool](http://www.resolvecorp.com/products.htm)&nbsp_place_holder;plugs into VS.NET and gives you wonderful things like:

  * Declarative Assertions (probably as close to design by contract as we can get without going to Eiffel) 
  * Code analysis (compiler warnings are better than unhandled exceptions) 
  * Code obfuscation (protect your work!)

I hope I like this. I'll let you know as soon as a decide.
