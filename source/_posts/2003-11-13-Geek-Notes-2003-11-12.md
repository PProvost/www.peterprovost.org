So my laptop harddrive bit the dust yesterday afternoon. Boy am I getting sick and tired of rebuilding computers. This morning I was given a new Inspiron 8500 from our IT guys and this machine rocks! The big screen is a crazy thing to get used to but I think I like it. USB 2.0, 75 GB drive, 1GB RAM... oh yeah.

Here is some of the good stuff I found today:

  * [World Rock Paper Scissors Society](http://www.worldrps.com/) - This site is nuts. Some people have way too much time on their hands. 
  * Jokes, jokes joke. [The Helicopter Joke](http://www.weijers.net/jokes/index.php?showJoke=25&startJoke=25) and [The Balloonist Joke](http://www.engineeringedu.com/jokes.html#The%20Balloon) were bounced around on WinTechOffTopic today. Always good for a laugh. 
  * [MsBuild GUI](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=2cb20e79-d706-4706-9ea0-26188257ee7d) - If you want to play with MsBuild and don't want to write the XML by hand. 
  * [Getting Session State in HttpHandlers](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c091b918-326c-43b0-812f-f291970465f0) - Scott Hanselman shows us a nice trick. It always surprises me how few people know about ASHX files... 
  * [Nicotine Is Good For You?](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031112072839.htm) - Apparently in small doses it is... 
  * [Windows XP SP2: A Developer's View](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/securityinxpsp2.asp) - This MSDN article talks about the upcoming service pack for Windows XP. The big focus seems to be security: network protection, memory protection, safer email and safer browsing. 
  * [Longhorn PDC Bits on MSDN Downloads](http://weblogs.asp.net/prieck/archive/11062003.aspx) - For subscribers that is... have fun, I'll bet that download will take all weekend.
