A colleage just sent me a link to this cool tool for those of you exploring the Whidbey beta.

Go visit:

[http://www.dotnet2themax.com/DotNetBrowser/ShowAssemblies.aspx](http://www.dotnet2themax.com/DotNetBrowser/ShowAssemblies.aspx)

From there you can dig down into any assembly in the .NET 2.0 framework and see what was added, changed or removed. Very cool.
