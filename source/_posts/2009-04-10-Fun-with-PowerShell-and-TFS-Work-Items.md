It all started with me wanting a better burndown chart for my team. That was relatively simple to solve as we've got some pretty good ones floating around inside Microsoft. (Apologies in advance but I can't share my spreadsheet with you at this time.)

Then came the fun... I wanted to be able to pull any given day's "work done" and "work remaining" data. But for my own reasons, I don't want this spreadsheet bound to the OLAP cube, I want to be able to mess with it.

Being the PowerShell junkie that I am I was pretty sure I could do this. I found [James Manning's killer "get-tfs.ps1" script](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmanning/archive/2006/09/28/776141.aspx) which meant I didn't have to work out that bit myself.

Using it is simple:
    
       1: $tfs = get-tfs http://mytfs:8080
    
       2: $wi = $tfs.wit.GetWorkItem(12345)

As you can see, I get the TFS client object via James's script, and then I pull a WorkItem from it. From there I can ask the $wi object for all the bits of information in the work item. Piping it to get-member showed me the following methods and properties:
    
       1:┬á 
    
       2:    TypeName: Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.WorkItem
    
       3:┬á 
    
       4: Name                   MemberType            Definition

Lots of great stuff there, but what I really wanted was the work done _on any given day_ and not the current work remaining. Hmmm...

After digging around in the object model (with PowerShell of course), I found the answer. The Revisions collection contains the full history of the Work Item. If I enumerated that, looking at the dates, I should be able to get what I want.

A little while later I had it all worked out, setup as a type extension in PowerShell so it automatically works with every WorkItem type I get. Type extensions are added via a special XML file (more info). Here's what I added to mine:
    
       1: <Type>
    
       2:     <Name>Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.WorkItem</Name>
    
       3:     <Members>
    
       4:         <ScriptMethod>
    
       5:             <Name>GetCompletedWorkByDate</Name>
    
       6:             <Script>
    
       1:┬á 
    
       2:                 $date = [datetime] $args[0]
    
       3:                 $total = 0
    
       4:                 $this.Revisions | % {
    
       5:                     if ($_.Fields['Changed Date'].Value.Date -eq $date) {
    
       6:                         $work = $_.Fields["Completed Work"]
    
       7:                         if ($work -ne $null) { $total += ([int] $work.Value) - ([int] $work.OriginalValue) }
    
       8:                     }
    
       9:                 }
    
      10:                 return $total
    
      11:             

</Script>
    
       7:         </ScriptMethod>
    
       8:         <ScriptMethod>
    
       9:             <Name>GetRemainingWorkByDate</Name>
    
      10:             <Script>
    
       1:┬á 
    
       2:                 $date = [datetime] $args[0]
    
       3:                 $total = 0
    
       4:                 $this.Revisions | % {
    
       5:                     if ($_.Fields['Changed Date'].Value.Date -le $date) {
    
       6:                         $work = $_.Fields["Remaining Work"]
    
       7:                         if ($work -ne $null) {
    
       8:                             $total = ([int] $work.Value)
    
       9:                         }
    
      10:                     }
    
      11:                 }
    
      12:                 return $total
    
      13:             

</Script>
    
      11:         </ScriptMethod>
    
      12:     </Members>
    
      13: </Type>

What this does is add two new methods to the .NET type Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.Workitem. The first method takes a date and returns the sum of the "Completed Work" field for all revisions that occurred on that date. The second method enumerates the same Revisions collection, but this time it process all revisions up through the given date looking for the last one that says anything about the "Remaining Work" field.

Next step... create a script to wrap all this up into an easy to use command I call get-burndowndata.ps1:
    
       1: param( 
    
       2:         $deliverable = $(throw "Must provide deliverable ID"),
    
       3:         $date = [datetime]::Now.Date 
    
       4: )
    
       5:┬á 
    
       6: $tfs = get-tfs [http://mytfs:8080](http://mytfs:8080)
    
       7: $deliverable = $tfs.WIT.GetWorkItem($deliverable) 
    
       8:┬á 
    
       9: $result = @()
    
      10:┬á 
    
      11: $deliverable.WorkItemLinks | ? { $_.LinkType.Name -eq "Child" } | % {
    
      12:     $feature = $tfs.WIT.GetWorkItem($_.TargetId)
    
      13:┬á 
    
      14:     $feature.WorkItemLinks | ? { $_.LinkType.Name -eq "Child" } | % {
    
      15:         $task = $tfs.WIT.GetWorkItem($_.TargetId)
    
      16:         $completed = $task.GetCompletedWorkByDate($date)
    
      17:         $remaining = $task.GetRemainingWorkByDate($date)
    
      18:┬á 
    
      19:         $obj = "" | select-object ID, Title, Completed, Remaining 
    
      20:         $obj.ID = $task.ID
    
      21:         $obj.Title = $task.Title
    
      22:         $obj.Completed = $completed
    
      23:         $obj.Remaining = $remaining
    
      24:┬á 
    
      25:         $result += $obj
    
      26:     }
    
      27: }
    
      28:┬á 
    
      29: $result

Now, getting any given day's burndown information is as simple as calling that script and opening the result in Excel:
    
       1: get-burndowndata.ps1 12345 "4/1/2009" | export-csv data_20090401.csv
    
       2: invoke-item data_20090401.csv

Works like a charm!

_**Disclaimer: **The get-burndowndata.ps1 script makes lots of assumptions about your TFS Work Item struction and relationships . It probably won't work unmodified for anyone outside of DevDiv._
