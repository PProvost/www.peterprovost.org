[This post on Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/22/2127236) pointed me to [this message](http://www.mit.edu:8008/bloom-picayune/crypto/14238) on The Cryptography Mailing List by Peter Gutmann. 

The gist is that CIPE, vtun and tinc--three popular open-source tunneling protocols--are terribly flawed. The worst part is that these flaws have been known for years but nobody has done anything about them. 

As Peter says in the posting: 

> At least Microsoft eventually tries to fix their stuff, given sufficient public embarrassment and the odd hundred thousand or so computers being taken out by attackers. 

I love this quote too... 

> Whenever someone thinks that they can replace SSL/SSH with something much better that they designed this morning over coffee, their computer speakers should generate some sort of penis-shaped sound wave and plunge it repeatedly into their skulls until they achieve enlightenment.
