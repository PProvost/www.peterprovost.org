Well, we shipped today. Now we enter that phase of a project that all developers hate... support. Waiting for the phone calls and emails to come in telling you that you let a bug through. Ugh. 

  * [NASA Scientists Get Custom 24h39m-per-day Watches](http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html) - Interesting... I wonder how long until we see one on eBay. [via [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/13/0239203)]
  * [TheServerSide.net](http://www.theserverside.net/news/index.aspx) - New site dedicated to building enterprise apps in .NET from The Middleware Company. ([rss](http://www.theserverside.net/rss/tssdotnet-news.xml)) [via [Craig Andera's Weblog](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b91051ef-5630-47c7-88b2-1bf571cbef7f)]
  * [Indigo Lingo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnlingo/html/indigolingo01062004.asp) - A new MSDN column dedicated to Indigo. The first article is "Creating Indigo Application with the PDC Release of Visual Studio .NET Whidbey" by Yasser Shohoud.
  * [Visendo SQL-Admin](http://www.visendo.com/en/sqladmin.aspx) - Freeware tool for administering MSDE (or SQL Server) databases. Particularly useful on Windows Server 2003 Web Edition. (via [The Daily Grind 271](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind271.html))
  * [Mustaches Give Cops More Authority](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=573&e=14&u=/nm/moustache_dc) - Cops in India are getting raises if they grow a moustache. Apparently it gives them "more authority". When my dad lived in Nigeria I remember a friend's driver telling me that he had a moustache because it made him look "more like a policeman" and that it "helped him avoid hassles at police checkpoints." Crazy. [via [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2004_01_01_archive.html#107402759908435801)]
