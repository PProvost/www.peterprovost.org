![irc](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/DotNetNerdsAnIRCchannelforus_CF00/irc_3.png) In my last post I mentioned my return to IRC. I did some digging around on freenode.net and efnet.org, but couldn't seem to find a channel for .Net nerds to hang out.

So I created one: [irc://freenode/DotNetNerds](irc://freenode/DotNetNerds)

Go grab yourself a copy of Chatzilla, or X-Chat or use mibbit.com, and come on over to freenode.net and the #DotNetNerds channel. Maybe something interesting will happen there. You never know unless you try.
