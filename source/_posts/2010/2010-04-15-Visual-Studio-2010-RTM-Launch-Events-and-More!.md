It seems very unlikely that you missed it, but [Visual Studio 2010 and .NET
Framework 4.0 has officially
launched](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2010/04/11/announcing-visual-studio-2010-and-net-framework-4.aspx)!
I can't adequately express how excited we are about this release. There is so
much good stuff in there, it is hard to know where to start.

I want to congratulate the thousands of people who spent the last two years
working on this release. I've had the pleasure of working with many of them as
we built out all the great new architecture features in [Visual Studio 2010
Ultimate](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/ultimate).

For those of you who've been creating models in the architecture tools in RC
and Beta2, we just shipped the [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Architecture Model
Upgrade
Tool](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/eb401aac-2926-4043-b355-7d2ede848541)
on the VS Gallery. Check it out.

We also just shipped the RTM version of the [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
Visualization & Modeling
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0def949d-2933-49c3-ac50-e884e0ff08a7&displaylang=en)
(n&eacute;e the Domain Specific Language Toolkit SDK). Jean-Marc Prieur has just
posted an [announcement post about
it](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmprieur/archive/2010/04/12/the-rtm-version-of-the-visual-studio-modeling-and-visualization-sdk-is-now-available.aspx).

The Vegas launch event was a hit, and it is being followed up by a bunch of
regional events. I will be speaking on Tuesday April 20th at the [Denver
event](http://www.communitymegaphone.com/ShowEvent.aspx?EventID=2769), so if
you're in town, please SIGN UP and come on out.
