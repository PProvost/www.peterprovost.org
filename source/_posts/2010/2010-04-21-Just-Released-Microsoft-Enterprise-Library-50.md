[![image](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/JustReleasedMicrosoftEnterpriseLibrary.0/23544F5A/image.png)](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2010/04/20/microsoft-enterprise-library-5-0-released.aspx)When I first joined _patterns & practices_ more almost six years ago, I moved right into the "delta lounge" which was the triangular-shaped team room where we created EntLib 1.0.

Who's have thought that we'd now be up to EntLib 5.0, but here we are.

For all the details of the new features and capabilities in this version, please read the [official announcement on Grigori Melnik's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2010/04/20/microsoft-enterprise-library-5-0-released.aspx).

Congrats to the EntLib Team for another great release!
