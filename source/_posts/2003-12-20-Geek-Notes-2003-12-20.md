Here are a few interesting things I found last night. 

  * [Famous Unsolved Codes and Ciphers](http://www.elonka.com/UnsolvedCodes.html) - Are you a bored crypto genius? Some of these are _old_.
  * [MUTE: Simple Private File Sharing](http://mute-net.sourceforge.net/) - Apparently designed from the ground up to deal with the RIAA snooping.
  * [Teach Yourself Emacs in 24 Hours](http://home.no.net/skund/emacs/) - I've been thinking about learning emacs for years. Historically, I'm a vi guy, but I've always wondered... so far it is pretty confusing. I like having a shell window and an editing buffer open side by side.
  * [Building Disconnected Applications](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/plaudeman/posts/3614.aspx) - Paul Laudeman posts a list of useful articles for building so called "smart clients"... Windows Forms applications that work both online and offline. Keep your eyes open in the coming months, because MS has a new application block on the way for just this kind of thing.

Off to bed...
