So there I am browsing a couple of internal sites suddenly IE7 switches into a mode where it shows me thumbnails of all my open tabs. 

"Wha happan??"

I pressed ESC and it went away. But then I couldn't figure out what did it. No combination of Shift, Ctrl, Alt + Tab would do it. Hmmm... Oh well... Back to work. 

Five minutes later it happened again. Twice was enough for me to find the pattern. 

I was using Outlook Web Access (aka OWA). For a long time I've been a stickler for keeping track of which messages I've really read and which I haven't. So in regular Outlook, I turn off the "auto mark as read" feature of the preview pane and manually mark as read or unread using Ctrl+Q and Ctrl+U. 

&nbsp_place_holder;I thought that back in IE6, Ctrl+Q behaved that way in OWA too, and for all I know the code is still there. But now, in IE7, when I press Ctrl+Q I get the thumbnail view:

Very cool! Not sure how much I'll use it, but it is neat. It also got me wondering about other shortcuts. I'm sure there are more, but I also found that it support Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. for direct selection of tabs. (Firefox does this too.)
