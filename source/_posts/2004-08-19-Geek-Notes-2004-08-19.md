Tomorrow is my last day at Interlink. I'm both sad and excited. Sad to leave a wonderful group of people who I know are going to do exciting things in the coming years. Excited to go work wit a wonderful group of people who I know are going to do exciting things in the coming years.

On the home front, the basement is now ready for primer, paint and a few finishing touches. The drywall crew finished the tape, mud and texture this morning and the carpet crew did this install this evening. Since we fly to Seattle on Monday, I don't think I could have cut this any closer, eh?

  * [Krispy Kreme Doghnuts: King of the Doughnut Heap](http://www.craftygal.com/archives/301/stump301.htm)&nbsp_place_holder;- What could the secret ingredient be? Nobody knows, but if you don't have one of these near you, look for them the next time you travel. We got a Krispy Kreme store in Denver a couple of years ago and now I can't eat any other kind.
  * [Rory Coming to Colorado](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7623.aspx) - Looks like he'll be here right after I leave, but if you live in Colorado, go see him. He is a funny speaker and the topics look very interesting.

  * [Darrell Norton on Software Factories](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/archive/2004/08/17/22302.aspx) - SF seem to be the "next big thing", but Darrell doesn't think they are applicable most of the time. Interesting thoughts...
  * [Undeploy BizTalk Assemblies](http://martijnh.blogspot.com/2004/08/update-undeployassembly.html) - Marijn Hoogendoorn has released a nice little tool that can make undeploying BizTalk assemblies a lot easier. It can even undeploy EVERYTHING on your BizTalk machine. Cool.
