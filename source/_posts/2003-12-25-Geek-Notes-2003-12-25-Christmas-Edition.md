Call me a geek and I'll admit it. Here I am blogging on Christmas day while my two year old naps. She had a wonderful time tearing open presents yelling "Happy Day!" (She confuses Christmas with Birthdays.) 

  * [Open Source Java Implementation of WS-Security](http://axis-wsse.sourceforge.net/#home) - Now you can start playing with this stuff from Java without paying BEA or IBM. [via [Christian Weyer's Weblog](http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/posts/45098.aspx)] 
  * [DeCSS Author Acquitted](http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=696330) - The verdict wasn't expected until January but it came a bit early. 
  * [Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2003](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20031222.html) - Jakob Neilsen has posted his take on what we all did wrong in 2003. 
  * [Mary Jo Foley Interviews Don Box](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,1418556,00.asp) - Don talks about the origins of Indigo, the status of SOAP, SOAs and the Mono project. No dirt, but interesting nonetheless.
