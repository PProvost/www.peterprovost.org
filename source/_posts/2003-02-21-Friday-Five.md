1. What is your most prized posession?

> Right now it is probably my [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com). I know that is stupid, but with my work schedule, new baby and the rest of my life, it is the only way I get to watch the shows I like.

2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?

> Actually, this one is easy. I was given a CD player and 5 CDs in 1985. I was a headbanger then and I still have one of those CDs... [Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FDQ/peterprovosto-20).

3. Are you a packrat?

> I hate it, but I am. Especially with tech/geek crap. I have a table in my basement where I collect dead computers and electronics so I can dismantle them for the parts. (I occasionally get into building [BEAM Robots](http://www.peterprovost.org/ow.asp?BeamRobotics) and the parts are useful.)

4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?

> When I walk into a spic-and-span clean house, I like it at first. But when I try to do it myself, I find that I'm spendinig all of my time either "putting things away" or "getting them back out". So I prefer the look of spic-and-span but I can't do it.

5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?

> No themes. My wife likes photos, so we have lots of those around.
