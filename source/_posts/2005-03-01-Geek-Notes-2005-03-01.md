As [I mentioned the other day](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/02/26/2925.aspx), I'm playing with Ruby again. A little more seriously this time. I've also been introduced by [Ward Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) to the [IO programming language](http://www.iolanguage.com/). A very interesting prototype based language. Ward, genius that he is, implemented a rich unit testing framework in IO with less than 20 lines of code. He used some cool techniques that you can only do with prototype based languages and I've been trying to duplicate his efforts in [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). Not much luck so far, but I'm still trying.

  * [Getting Your Book, DVD or CD on Amazon](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000668.php) - I had no idea it was this easy. [via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/26/howto_get_a_cd_dvd_o.html)]
  * [Esuvee.com](http://esuvee.com/) - I went to see Hitch with my wife last week and there was an public service message advertising this site before the film started. Apparently it is an attempt by various federal and state agencies to educate people about how to be safe in their Suburban Utility Vehicles. I love the crazy Sesame Street monster thingy.
  * [What Great .NET Developers Ought to Know](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,d835178f-a649-45f5-907f-28ad1177d8d5.aspx) - Scott Hanselman posts his list. This may be the best one yet.
  * [Triple LCD Developer Setup](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000217.html) - I agree with Jeff on this one. Three monitors should be the standard developer setup. I run two right now and as soon as I can figure out how to get three on my laptop without spending $1000 for a SideCar, I'm in. I'm thinking about adding a PCMCIA video card, but it seems that there aren't many on the market anymore.
  * [America's Dumbest Laws to be Violated All Summer](http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1425731,00.html) - Ha ha ha haΓÇª
  * [New Patch for Enterprise Library 1.0](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2005/03/01/382548.aspx) - Scottden et al. have posted a number of new hacks and samples for EntLib, including "a provider and designer for storing configuration in your app.config / web.config, registry and Sql Server."
