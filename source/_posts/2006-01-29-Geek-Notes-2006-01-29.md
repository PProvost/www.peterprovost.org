Another rainy Seattle weekend goes by. Today's rain is real rain tooΓÇª not that drizzly stuff we normally have, but real rain. We had a bunch of new friends over for Sunday brunch today. Eight adults and six kids was a bit much for&nbsp_place_holder;a house the size of ours, but it was a lot of fun.

  * [Virtualizing Access to Content: Serving Your Web Site from a ZIP File](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/vpp_vga.asp) - In this new article up on MSDN, [Victor Garcia Aprea](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/vga/) shows off one of the new features in ASP.NET 2.0, virtual path providers, by storing the website content in a ZIP file and serving the pages on the fly. Very cool stuff.
  * [Gnomedex Registration Is Open](http://www.gnomedex.com/) - I've always wanted to go, but it has never been possible for me. This year it is in Seattle, so maybe I can make it this time.
  * [Subversion Hosting](http://www.wush.net/subversion.php) - I saw this recently recommended on a mailing list I'm on. Looks like a pretty good service for outsourced SVN repositories. The Professional level even has integrated bug tracking and wiki.
  * [Why Visual Studio Intellisense Sucks](http://www.doitwith.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=fe56e809-1ec6-40e3-bea0-229f30aabf9f) - Mark Miller, of CodeRush fame, writes a very insightful post about intellisense. It is very interesting because I know that Intellisense has impacted API design and usability thinking (for the better) in the past few years, but at the same time, I think Mark is rightΓÇª it could be a lot better.
  * [The New Ruby-Doc.org](http://www.ruby-doc.org/) - Wow. The guys over at ruby-doc.org have done an excellent job with their recent redesign. Nice work.
  * [E-Prime](http://www.nobeliefs.com/eprime.htm) - I was pointed to this by my friend [Alan Ridlehoover](http://blogs.msdn.com/aridle/default.aspx) on one of the internal mailing lists. Since I first discovered it, I've been trying to think about what it would actually take to change my language to that style permanently, but I don't know if I can do it. Or even if I should.
  * [Good Experience Games](http://www.goodexperience.com/games/) - I find myself constantly returning to this list to see what new games he's got. I don't know why it took me so long to find his RSS feed, but now I've subscribed and don't have to go looking anymore. From the guy who brought you one of my other favorite blogs:&nbsp_place_holder;[ThisIsBroken.com](http://www.thisisbroken.com/).
