[![Dark Visual Studio](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/DarkVisualStudioImhooked_F3DE/image_thumb.png)](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/DarkVisualStudioImhooked_F3DE/image_2.png)I admit I was skeptical when Brad Wilson was talking to me about his [Dark Visual Studio color scheme](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/09/07/19030.aspx). Oddly enough, though, I've used a dark scheme in Vim for quite a while, so it should have felt more natural to me.

Lately I've been doing a lot more coding and decided to give it a shot. I'm now one week in and I'm hooked. I'm using Brad's settings (Consolas version) unmodified and are very nice on the eyes.

The screenshot on the right is of my current setup, as I typically run it, with all Tool Windows hidden but accessible via keystrokes.

In his post he mentions his "black-on-white with presentation tweaks" settings, but I don't think he's posted it. GIVE IT! ![Tongue out](http://messenger.msn.com/MMM2006-04-19_17.00/Resource/emoticons/tongue_smile.gif)
