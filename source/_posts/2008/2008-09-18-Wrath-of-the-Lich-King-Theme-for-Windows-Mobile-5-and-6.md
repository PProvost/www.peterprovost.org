Last night I finally got around to upgrading my Blackjack to Windows Mobile 6.0. I'd been delaying because they didn't have an updater that ran on Vista and I don't have an XP machine available. Once the Vista updater arrived, I put it on the backlog.

I had an old WoW theme for my Blackjack but I decided it was time to make a new one. Here's a photo of it running on my phone:
