[![VSTS Logo](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/LayerValidationwiththeVSTS2010CTP_6F96/VSTS%20Logo_thumb.png)](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/LayerValidationwiththeVSTS2010CTP_6F96/VSTS%20Logo_2.png) Cameron Skinner has recently made two excellent blog posts that give a great explanation of how to use Layer Diagrams for architecture and design validation in your code. He shows you the basics of creating a layer diagram and binding it to your solution elements. He then shows you how to incorporate that validation right into your build!

  * [Layer Validation with the VSTS 2010 CTP](http://blogs.msdn.com/camerons/archive/2008/12/09/layer-validation-with-the-vsts-2010-ctp.aspx)
  * [Incorporate Layer Validation in your Builds](http://blogs.msdn.com/camerons/archive/2008/12/11/incorporate-layer-validation-in-your-builds.aspx)

Excellent stuff you should certainly go read.

(For all this stuff, you will need to be running the [VSTS 2010 CTP](http://blogs.msdn.com/briankel/archive/2008/10/27/helpful-links-for-the-visual-studio-2010-ctp.aspx).)
