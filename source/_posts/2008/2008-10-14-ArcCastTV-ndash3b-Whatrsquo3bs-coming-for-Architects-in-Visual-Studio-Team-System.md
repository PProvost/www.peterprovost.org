Somehow this slipped past me, but a couple of weeks ago a webcast that I did
with local Architect Evangelist Joe Shirey posted up on Channel9.

Here's the official description:

> **[ARCast.TV - Peter Provost on what's coming for Architects in Visual Studio
> Team
> System](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/ARCast.TV/ARCastTV-Peter-Provost-on-whats-coming-for-Architects-in-Visual-Studio-Team-System/)**
> 
> The upcoming version of Visual Studio Team System (code named Rosario) has a
> number of new features and functions for Architects. Senior Program Manager
> of Visual Studio Team System for Architects Edition, [Peter
> Provost](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/), sits down with [Joe
> Shirey](http://www.joeshirey.com/) to discuss what investments Microsoft has
> made into the product and how it will potentially improve the lives of
> Architects.

In addition to that, a number of other great webcasts have been going up by my
team mates and other VSTS folks. We've created a special section on Channel9
for all of this great content at

so please go check it out!
