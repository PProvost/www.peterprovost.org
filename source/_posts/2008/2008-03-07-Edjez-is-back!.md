My good friend Eduardo Jezierski has returned to the blog-o-sphere. [His new blog](http://edjez.instedd.org/) is up and running and his first post explains what he's been doing at [InSTEDD](http://www.instedd.org/) since leaving Microsoft.

He's promised me that he'll blog about all kinds of interesting technology and how they're using it for really cool humanitarian efforts around the world.

Good to see you Ed and good luck on your mission!
