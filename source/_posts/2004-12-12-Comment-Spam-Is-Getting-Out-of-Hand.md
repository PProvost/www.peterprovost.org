I know other's have complained about it in the past, but suddenly in the last 3 days, I'm getting assaulted. I check a few times a day and am finding more and more each time. The pace of these bastards is increasing!

I've considered disabling comments site wide, but I really don't want to do that. I've thought about [adding a CAPTCHA](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=99b2e3e9-5597-4883-a015-d77c3246a2a8) to the comment control. Or maybe posts older than a certain age (say 30 days) should automatically have comments disabled.

You know, since these guys are almost certainly using an engine for this, I wonder if just randomizing the input element's name would work. Has anyone tried this?

Regardless, I've got to do something or I'm gonna end up with nothing BUT comments.
