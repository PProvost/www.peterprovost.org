Very Cool! [Jamie Cansdale](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/) [posts about how he caught MSBlast](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/posts/24257.aspx) running inside his home network. He mentions a tool called [Ethereal](http://www.ethereal.com/) that I can't wait to play with at home. I've always wanted a good packet sniffer for my XP box.
