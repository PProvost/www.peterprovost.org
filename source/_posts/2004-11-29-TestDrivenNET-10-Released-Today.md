![Testdriven.net.logo](/Files/testdriven.net.logo.gif)[Jamie Cansdale](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin) just dropped me a note giving me the scoop on the new 1.0 release of [TestDriven.NET](http://www.testdriven.net/Default.aspx?ReferrerId=134). Formerly known as NUnitAddin, this is an indispensable tool for the .NET developer. **_You gotta have it!_**

From the home page: 

> TestDriven.NET makes it easy to run unit tests with a single click, anywhere in your Visual Studio solutions. It supports all versions of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET meaning you don't have to worry about compatibility issues and fully integrates with all major unit testing frameworks including NUnit, MbUnit, csUnit & Visual Studio Team System. 

In addition to being&nbsp_place_holder;more solid and reliable than any previous release (as far as I can tell so far), the 1.0 version also: 

  * No longer has those annoying timeouts (but now you are responsible for making sure you stay up to date yourself)
  * Has an excellent Quick Start that shows you exactly how to get up and running quickly
  * Has a new MSI installer that allows you to specify which test runners you want to use
  * Supports very cool pseudo-categories for collecting all kinds of interesting information. (More on this later, but for a hint see [this post I made a year ago](/archive/2003/10/30/901.aspx).)
  * Has lots of bug fixes

To download it, visit [www.TestDriven.net](http://www.testdriven.net/Default.aspx?ReferrerId=134), register go to the download page, and fill out the survey. You'll only have to do it once,&nbsp_place_holder;and Jamie has ensured me that the information will only be used to improve the product and better understand how people are using it. (Expect some good blog posts from him once he has enough data to make some generalizations.)
