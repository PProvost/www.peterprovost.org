I'm back! Man, when everyone else (not me) takes tons of vacation over the holidays, they get back and have tons of crazy stuff for everyone else (me) to do! Oh well, as my friend AaronX says, I'd rather be busy than bored. 

  * [Heathkit.Virtual.Museum](http://www.heathkit-museum.com/) - My dad built a few Heathkit projects back in the day. It really is too bad that this company doesn't exist anymore. For those of you interested in building electronic kits, there are a few choices. [Solarbotics.com](http://www.solarbotics.com/) has a nice collection of [BEAM Robot](http://www.beam-online.com/) kits. I've built a couple and they are fun. If you are into musical instruments, [PAiA](http://www.paia.com/) makes a bunch of kits including a very nice looking [Theremin](http://www.thereminworld.com/).

  * [Acid Trip](http://www.cowboybooks.com.au/html/acidtrip1.html) - Supposedly from a 1950's test on the effects of LSD, this set of slides shows a set of portraits and quotes from someone going through a pretty heavy acid trip. Those were the days...
  * [Language Divergence in Whidbey](http://www.sdtimes.com/cols/winwatch_093.htm) - [Larry O'Brien](http://www.thinkingin.net/2004/01/04.aspx#a584) compares the original "language is a lifestyle choice" attitude of .NET 1.0 and 1.1 with the next release of .NET (codenamed Whidbey) language divergence will be the theme.
  * [A Plea for Full Multiple Inheritance in .NET](http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2004/01/04/47476.aspx) - Frans Bouma writes a 2100 word essay on why he thinks MI should be included in .NET. As a C++/ATL guy, I have to admit, sometimes I miss it. Most of the time, however, I don't.

I still have more than 500 unread posts in News Gator, but that'll do for now.
