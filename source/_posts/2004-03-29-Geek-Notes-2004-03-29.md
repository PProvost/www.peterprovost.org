Another day another dollar... or something like that. 

  * [How to Convert a System.String* to a char*](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=311259) - A coworker needed to do this and I founds this little MSDN post to help out. Worked like a charm.
  * [ASP.NET Overtakes JSP and Servlets](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=24695) - "According to a Netcraft report in March 2004, ASP.NET has more IP public addresses that JSP & Servlets, showing 'very strong growth' in the past year 'with a 224% increase.'"
  * [Craig Andera Leaves GDN Workspaces](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=48e5c866-91d0-428e-a355-5132e04d6214) - Craig has joined Dare Obasanjo and left GDN Workspaces in favor of SourceForge. [Andy Oakley responded](http://blogs.msdn.com/aoakley/archive/2004/03/26/97205.aspx), but I don't think he actually addressed Craig's complaint.
  * [Disposable iPods?](http://broken.typepad.com/b/2004/03/apples_ipod_rep.html) - No, Apple doesn't have a new product. It just turns out that repairing the old one sometimes costs as much or more than replacing it.
  * [The .NET Framework Standard Library Annotated Reference Vol 1](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/03/25/96251.aspx) - Brad Abrams talks about his new book. I got a copy in the mail the other day (courtesy of the MVP program I think) and I have to admit, I dig it.
  * [More WSS API Woes](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/03/25/279.aspx) - Kris and I are on different but similar SharePoint project and it has been fun (or not) finding all the problems in the WSS API.
