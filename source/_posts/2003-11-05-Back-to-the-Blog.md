After all that PDC blogging, I needed a few days away from this thing. I'm trying to catch up on my RSS feeds, but I have to admit to doing a bunch of "Mark All Read" to help me out. Oh well... anything really important will show up in more than one place, right?

Here are some of the interesting things that I found today:

  * [CLR Profiler 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=86ce6052-d7f4-4aeb-9b7a-94635beebdda&displaylang=en) - many new features
  * [Source Gear Vault Single User License](https://store.sourcegear.com/Sales/catalog.asp) - $49 is a good deal. Not as cheap as [CVSNT](http://www.cvsnt.org/) though...
  * [XAML is for more than just UI](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-11-04T09:14:15Z) - Don Box hints about all the other things you can do with XAML
  * [PACMAN in Excel](http://www.geocities.jp/nchikada/pac/) - You've got to be kidding me...
  * [ADO.NET 2.0 Database Independence](http://weblogs.asp.net/cnagel/posts/34657.aspx) - They've finally fixed the biggest oversight in ADO.NET
  * [Lap Around Longhorn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20031028LHORNDB/manifest.xml) - The MSDN TV version of the PDC keynote demo
  * [A Brief History of XAML](http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/100aec62-3352-4c35-b471-f3f2fa5fac5a) - Chris Anderson tells us how they got to where they are now...
  * [PDC DVDs are Available](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/after/default.aspx) - $199 for attendees, $499 for everyone else

That'll do for├é now...
