[AaronX](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/default.htm) sent me [this eBay listing](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2162414185). If only I had a spare $12K laying around. I'm re-reading [Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380973464/peterprovosto-20) right now and everytime I read that I get back into crypto. I can't help it, I've always had an attraction to cryptography.
