So my last post was about sunshine, but today's post is about snow.

Today here in Seattle it snowed. And everyone is freaking out. People are cancelling meetings left and right and running home "in case the snow gets bad."

Coming from Colorado, "snow gets bad" means more than a foot or so during the day. Anything less than that and you keep right on working.

But here, apparently, even the sight of snow send the locals into a panic. I've been told there are no snow-plows (I had to explain to someone today what one is), there are no sand/salt trucks. Nothing. So everyone just runs home.

Hilarious.
