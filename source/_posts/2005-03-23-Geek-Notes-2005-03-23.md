As I said this morning, I haven't been reading blogs much, so I haven't had much to say in Geek Notes, but I have been collecting things in my "Geek Notes working copy" in BlogJet that you might enjoy, so here's what I have today.

  * [MakeMeAdmin Follow-up](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2005/03/11/394244.aspx) - Aaron Margosis has posted an important follow-up to his MakeMeAdmin tools and also explains some very important issues regarding the "default owner" issues on Windows XP. A must-read post if you are running non-admin.
  * [iTunes SDK for Windows](http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html) - As I mentioned the other day, I'm doing a lot of bittorrent downloads of live music. The goal for me is to get it into iTunes so I can get it into my iPod Shuffle. The conversion from FLAC/SLN to MP3 is easyΓÇª a quick batch file and I'm done. But I wanted to do the iTunes import too. Looks like it may be possible with the IITLibraryPlaylist::AddFiles method. We'll see.

  * [Skeleton Sketches](http://www.michaelpaulus.com/gallery/character-Skeletons) - This is a cool gallery of sketches done Michael Paulus. "I decided to take a select few of these popular characters&nbsp_place_holder;[Ed: from 60s cartoons] and&nbsp_place_holder;render their skeletal systems as I imagine they might resemble if one truly had eye sockets half the size of its head, or fingerless-hands, or feet comprising 60% of its body mass."

  * [Giant Steps](http://www.michalevy.com/gs_download.html) - My good friend Karl Hungus (sic) sent this to a mailing list we are on together. It is an amazingly cool Flash animation put to the music of John Coltrane's Giant Steps.
  * [How Not to Teach Your Kids About Gun Safety](http://www.compfused.com/directlink/680/) - I can't believe this guy kept going with the demonstration after shooting himself in the legΓÇª or is it a fake? Looks pretty real.
