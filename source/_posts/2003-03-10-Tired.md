Yep. I'm tired. In three days we re-plumbed the house and ripped out a basement closet in preparation for refinishing my basement, which will happen sometime later this year. I love it when my dad comes to town... we always do a construction project. They always claim to be coming to visit [Hadley](http://www.provost.org/the-kid.asp), but we always seem to end up building (or demolishing) something. Now I have to go back to work writing code, having meetings, etc. Oh well...
