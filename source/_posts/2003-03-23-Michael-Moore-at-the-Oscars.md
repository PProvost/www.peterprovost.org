I found it quite fascinating to see Michael Moore get booed off the stage during his acceptance speech for [Bowling for Columbine](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0310793). This is an industry that is absolutely dependent on the right to freedom of speech. When he stood up there and made his rant about [GWB](http://www.whitehouse.gov) being a fake president, the war being illegal and all the rest of it, the audience should have politely let him collect his award and leave the stage. Booing him off was stupid.

All that aside, Steve Martin's line was funny when they came back from commercial... "The Teamsters are out back helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his car..."
