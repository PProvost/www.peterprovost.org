In case you read my blog and not [Don Box's blog](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) I wanted post a link to his answer to [my post about C# generics](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d8fbf677-bbe2-4624-b559-8292ab90b9b2). It looks like my answer wasn't necessarily wrong, but also wasn't the real answer.

[Here is Don't first post](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-08-17T06:21:14Z) which explains the answer. [Here is a follow up post](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-08-17T06:52:30Z) which explains delegate compatibility. I think understanding this last bit is going to be very important when we all start actually using generics, so this is a very useful bit&nbsp_place_holder;of information. Thanks Don.
