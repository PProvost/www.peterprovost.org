I have a strange fear. I've had it for a while. I've had it since [I bought my Motorola MPx200 SmartPhone](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2003/11/21.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;more than two years ago.

I have a fear of dropping my phone in the toilet.

It is most pronounced at work. I suspect that you know what I'm talking about. Tiny little toilet stalls. Phone on your belt clip. As you go in and turn around, there is a point in time where your expensive little phone is dangling precariously over the toilet bowl. And since this is a public place and not in a house full of women (like my house), there is no cover to stop things falling in.

![Samsung i730](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/i730_programs.jpg)Last week my telepottyphobia got even worse with the retirement of my [Motorola MPx200](http://motoinfo.motorola.com/motoinfo/products.asp?product=MPx200&y=2003) and the acquisition of my new [Samsung SCH-I730](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/articles/i730.mspx). If carrying around a $300 phone was bad, carrying around a $600 phone is worse. (FWIW, I didn't pay that much for either phone, but those are the list prices.)

But let me change focus here for a sec and talk about this phone.

This thing rocks. It is small. It does [EVDO data](http://www.evdoinfo.com/EVDO/Info/What_is_EVDO?_2005021237/), which gets up to 1Mb download speed. I've never had a phone or a small device that could pull data this fast.

It is a full blown Pocket PC, so you can do lots of things that you can't do with a SmartPhone. It has a slide out keyboard, which despite its small size, is actually useable.

The Outlook integration is killer. I thought my SmartPhone was getting me well connected, but this is even better. Because I have the "all you can eat" data plan from Verizon, I can have it sync as much as&nbsp_place_holder;I want.

It supports BlueTooth, so I also got a [Motorola HS850 headset](http://motorola.digitalriver.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&SiteID=motostor&Locale=en_US&Env=BASE&productID=36061500). Unfortunately, my laptop doesn't do BT, so I'm gonna have to get a BT dongle if I want to sync over the air.

It also supports WiFi, but with the unlimited data plan, I don't have it turned on. (I've also been told it sucks the battery dry, so I'm not that unhappy about that.)

And finally, to combat my fear of hearing the plopping sound when my phone hits the water, I went ahead and bought the insurance plan offered by Verizon. Strangely, I'm still paranoid about dropping it, but at least now if (when?) it happens, I'll be able to get a replacement phone. ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile1.gif)
