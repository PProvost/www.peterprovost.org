It is that time of year around hereΓÇª

> **WS-I Basic Security Profile Sample Application Preview**
> 
> One of the most requested deliverables we have heard since Enterprise Library has been released, is an end-to-end sample that shows the blocks in action. The great news is that we now have this, in the form of the [WS-I Basic Security Profile Sample Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/MSWSIBSP.asp). In addition to showing the use of the Enterprise Library blocks, the sample app also demonstrates how to build secure and interoperable web services based on the WS-I group's basic and security profiles. The current release of the sample application uses .NET 1.1 and WSE 2.0; an early preview for .NET 2.0 and WSE 3.0 is due for release this week at the [WS-I Sample App Community Site](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/workspace.aspx?id=0fecd2c7-b2b1-4d85-bd66-9d07a6ecbd86).
