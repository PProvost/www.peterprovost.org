Whew. Had a few minutes to catch up on some RSS content now that the ADS is over. 

  * [Don't Let Your Dog Drive on Pills](http://broken.typepad.com/b/2004/02/dog_medication_.html) - This is from one of my favorite sites, "This Is Broken". I get more laughs from this site than any other single source.
  * [Sanjay's Coding Tips :: MSDE Tools](http://sastools.com/b2/post/79394219) - A nice collection of information about using MSDE effectively. (via [Paul Bartlett](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/pdbartlett/archive/2004/02/09/894.aspx))
  * [Drum Machine](http://www.tokyoplastic.com/drummachine.html) - Every now and then a new Flash movie makes the rounds. My good friend AaronX sent me this one and it could easily be the next one... very very cool.
  * [Power Point Presenting Dos and Donts](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d017c9f3-aa3d-47bc-8d39-e6bfd8358d24) - Since I've been doing tons more presenting lately than ever before, I stop and read posts like this very carefully. Especially when they are from Scott Hanselman.
  * [Dillo](http://www.dillo.org/) - A tiny little open-source web browser written entirely in C from scratch. Less than 350K in size. [via [Stefano Demiliani](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/demiliani/archive/2004/02/10/6913.aspx))
  * [wx.NET](http://wxnet.sourceforge.net/) - An implementation of wxWindows for .NET. Allows cross platform GUI development in .NET (supports .NET, Mono and DotGnu). [via [Stefano Demiliani](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/demiliani/archive/2004/02/10/6914.aspx)]

Enjoy!
