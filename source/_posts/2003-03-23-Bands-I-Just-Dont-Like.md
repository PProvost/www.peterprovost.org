I'm sorry, but I refuse to feel guilty about this. When U2 came on stage at the Oscars I cringed. I probably wouldn't have posted anything if I hadn't had two different discussions about this kind of thing lately. There are a handful of bands/artists who I don't like that cause people to get very annoyed when they hear my opinion. U2 is one of them. Here is an abridged list (in no particular order) of bands that I don't really like and that I refuse to feel guilty about not liking. (Did that sentence make sense?)

  * U2
  * Bruce Springsteen
  * Rolling Stones
  * Neil Young
  * Elvis

Of course there are many more musicians that I don't really like, but the members of this list seem to be the ones that get me the most grief. And I wouldn't say that I actively dislike all of them, but I just don't care. I mean, I don't rush to change the station when the Stones come on the radio, but I just don't give a crap. It is BORING. (I do change the station when U2 comes on... can't even say why.)

There are musicians that I actively dislike (Avril Levigne for├é one), but I'll leave that for a future rant.
