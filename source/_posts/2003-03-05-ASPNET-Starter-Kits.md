> The ASP.NET team continues to pump out sample code to encourage people to adapt their ideas and architecture. In conjunction with the current VSLive conference, they've made available five "[starter kits](http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=9&tabid=47)" in beta form. These applications are designed to get you up and running with useful ASP.NET architectures quickly. [[Larkware News](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/MoreASP.NETSamples.html)]

There's also a new sample smart client on [.NET Client Web](http://www.windowsforms.net) called [TaskVision](http://www.windowsforms.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=44). Includes support for several interesting smart client technologies:

  * Application offline and online model 
  * Application update model via HTTP (no-touch deployment) 
  * Authorization to control user access to application features 
  * Data collision handling 
  * Printing and Print Preview 
  * Windows XP Themes 
  * Dynamic properties 
  * Localization support 
  * Accessibility support (limited) 
  * Forms authentication using a database for user names/passwords 
  * Asynchronous XML Web service class 
  * ADO.NET data access using SQL stored procedures 
  * Graphics development using GDI+ 
  * Integration between .NET Framework-based code and COM applications (COM interop)
