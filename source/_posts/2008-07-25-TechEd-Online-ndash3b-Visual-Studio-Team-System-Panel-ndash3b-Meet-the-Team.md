![TEOPanel_10](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TechEdOnlineVisualStudioTeamSystemPanelM_C46B/TEOPanel_10_3.jpg) At TechEd last month I was part of a VSTS panel called "Meet the Team" with Brian Harry, Normal Guadagno, Gert Drapers, Habib Heydarian and Neelesh Kamkolkar. It was a fun talk (I arrived seconds late and ran on stage after it started--hence that empty leftmost seat in the picture) and we cover a lot of VSTS Rosario material in a short time.
