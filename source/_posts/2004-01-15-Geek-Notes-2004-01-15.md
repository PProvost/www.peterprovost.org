Well my cold seems to be getting better, although I did spend today working from home and yesterday under a blanket on the couch. 

My Outlook Add-In project ships tomorrow. It will be nice to get that done and off to the customer. Maybe I'll have more time to blog once that is done. We'll see. 

  * [Lego In Trouble](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040108/ap_on_bi_ge/denmark_lego_1) - Bummer. Apparently Lego had a bad loss last year. They've fired two execs and are considering layoffs. They also may be cancelling Mindstorms. Bummer. [via [Ole Eichhorn](http://w-uh.com/posts/040110.html)]
  * [The True Cost of Reflection](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/seichert/posts/5454.aspx) - Steve Eichert posts some very interesting results about the performance impacts of reflection based code in .NET. Steve Maine then follows that post up with [some more interesting results](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,14736081-2589-474a-b867-85fa1c33f4d7.aspx). Good stuff to know if you're using .NET reflection.
  * [Red vs Blue](http://www.redvsblue.com/) - Season 2 has started. Get it while its hot. [via [Adam Field](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/adam/archive/2004/01/12/583.aspx)]
  * [Spirit Goes for a Stroll](http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040115a.html) - Today the Mars Spirit rover wheeled off of the lander and took a look back. Now the good stuff can begin.
