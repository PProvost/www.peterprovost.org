I like WinAmp. I use a tiny little skin that sits right above the task bar on my XP desktop. Very nice. One thing bugs the heck out me though... if WinAmp has the focus and you press CTRL+F4, it closes! Argh. I use the keyboard almost exclusively, so when I'm in VS.NET and want to close the current window, I use CTRL+F4. But if I wasn't paying attention and the focus was on WinAmp, my tunes die! Bummer.
