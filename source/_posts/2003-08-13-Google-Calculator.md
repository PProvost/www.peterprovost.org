Yeah yeah, everyone is talking about it. But did you know it does square roots? Even negative ones? Trig? Unit conversions?

Try these:

  * sqrt(5)
  * sqrt(-5)
  * sine(30 degrees)
  * sine(pi radians)
  * 2 inches in millimeters
  * 30 fahrenheit in celsius

Combined with the google toolbar this rocks!
