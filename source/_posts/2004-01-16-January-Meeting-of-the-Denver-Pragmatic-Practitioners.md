Topic: Smart Clients (Are Web Interfaces Dead?) 

├é 

Lately Microsoft and others have been foretelling the end of web-interfaces in favor of so-called "Smart Clients". Come join a roundtable forum of your peers as we discuss what smart clients really are, whether we think this prediction is true, the technologies available and if web interfaces are really dead. 

├é 

Refreshments will be provided. 

├é 

We look forward to seeing you there.
