Have you ever suddenly gone into World of Warcraft and found yourself wondering, "what the hell is that button?" It happened to me a while back after a patch day update and I couldn't figure out which addon had put it there. It really started pissing me off. 

I jumped over to the #wowace IRC channel on Freenode.net and asked if anyone had any ideas. They didn't, but they did have a cool trick for figuring out the Frame's name. Assuming you have any one of the Ace addons installed on your system, you can just use this slash command in game: 

**/print GetMouseFocus():GetName()**

That will tell you the name of the frame which might help you figure out what addon created it. (It sure helped me.) 

Enjoy!
