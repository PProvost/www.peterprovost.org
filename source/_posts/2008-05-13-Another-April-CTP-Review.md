Jeff Levinson's has followed up [his last column](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/columns/article.aspx?editorialsid=2583) on the April 2008 VSTS CTP with a new one called [The Joy of Sequence Diagrams](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/columns/article.aspx?editorialsid=2617). 

In this article Jeff reviews the Logical Class Diagram and the Sequence Diagram. 

My favorite bit: 

> The benefit of the revamped diagrams is that not only can the represented information be semantic, but it can also be non-semantic. That is, it can be used to communicate ideas and thoughts without adding any particular constraints to a solution. This makes the new suite of diagrams in the Architecture Edition particularly powerful and useful. 

Hopefully Jeff will cover more in his upcoming articles.
