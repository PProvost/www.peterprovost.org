Topic:├é Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development 

After our spirited discussion in November about Source Control, we decided that we would discuss Unit Testing and TDD at our next meeting. Have you done TDD? What were your experiences like? Do you use JUnit, NUnit or one of the other unit testing frameworks? If we have time, we'll try to have a chat about FIT testing as well. Join the Denver Pragmatic Practitioners for a round-table discussion with your peers about what has worked and hasn't worked. 

We├é look forward to seeing you there.
