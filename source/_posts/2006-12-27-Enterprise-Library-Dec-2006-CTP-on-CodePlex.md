Here is some good news... Enterprise Library has been updated and has moved from its old home on GotDotNet to CodePlex! 

Here is their new site: [http://www.codeplex.com/entlib](http://www.codeplex.com/entlib)

For all the details, see [Tom Hollander's blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2006/12/22/just-released-enterprise-library-3-0-december-2006-ctp.aspx). Lots of good stuff in there. 

_PS. If you want to help us out a bit... click that codeplex link... just once... come on... you can do it... we want to be #1 on codeplex. :)_
