I know some people love him. In fact he's been [nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize](http://www.daypop.com/redirect?id=24375779). Ugh. U2's early stuff was good, but I guess I just don't really like my music and politics together. It just ends up sounding like I'm paying money to be whined at.

**UPDATE:** Sorry kids, but the comments are now closed on this post. You guys are just posting too much noise for me to manage or moderate it. It has been fun though.
