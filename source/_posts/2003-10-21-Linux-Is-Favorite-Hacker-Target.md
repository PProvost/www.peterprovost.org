(I can't believe this article didn't get bounced around more last month. I just found it today.)

In a study released by mi2g in September, they found that during August 2003:

  * 12,892 Linux servers were successfully breached (67%) 
  * 4,626 Windows servers were successfully breached (23.2%) 
  * 360 BSD servers were successfully breached (<2%)

I suppose some will claim that this count is skewed because "most servers on the net are running Linux" but I don't believe that. Especially when those same people say that Windows is a threat _because _it is installed on _so many_ systems.

I'm gonna download BSD this weekend. :)
