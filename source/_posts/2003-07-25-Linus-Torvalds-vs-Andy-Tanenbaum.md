Wow. I can't believe I've never read [this thread](http://people.fluidsignal.com/~luferbu/misc/Linus_vs_Tanenbaum.html) before. Originally posted to comp.os.minix on USENET, it documents a series of postings between Linus Torvals (author of the Linux kernel) and Andy Tanenbaum (author of MINIX).

Two things surprised me:

1. I didn't know Linus was such a hothead. Totally caught me off-guard when he started flaming the author of MINIX in the MINIX newsgroup.

2. I didn't know Andy was so opposed to Linux. Also, I didn't know that he was so close-minded about kernel design. I suppose that comes from being a professor who teaches in that subject area.
