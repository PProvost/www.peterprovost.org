Today was the [Redmond - Sammamish Mothers & More](http://www.redmondmothersandmore.org/) Summer Picnic at [Farrel McWhirter Park](http://www.ci.redmond.wa.us/insidecityhall/parksrec/parks/farrel.asp) in Redmond. This is a really cool park with a fully functional farm on site. Hadley has loved going there to see the animals since we moved here. I was responsible for the barbeque today and was kept busy feeding the 50+ people who came out. My wife [Emily](http://blogs.provost.org/emily) was responsible for organizing the event... congrats to her for making it a success.

  * [Enterprise Library 2.0 Cometh](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/archive/2005/08/01/446190.aspx) - I assume all .NET people saw this, but Scott Densmore has started talking about EntLib 2.0. (Six smileys, Scott? Are you kidding me?)
  * [The Wall of Sheep](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/07/_defcon_the_wal_1.html) - At the hacker conference DEFCON, anyone foolish enough to login to something in plaintext gets their username and passwords shown up on "the big board". Nice.
  * [Cool Ruby Collection Stuff](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CollectionClosureMethod.html) - Martin Fowler shows off a number of cool ruby things and compares them to Smalltalk.
  * [I/ON](http://openvision.tv/home/ion.html) - This is a cool browser, viewer, whatever for finding online videos. Ostensibly for reading videoblogs (think podcast with video), you can apparently find all kinds of interesting stuff with it.
  * [Uninstalling GAT If It Refuses To](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/08/02/CABAndGATIssues.aspx) - I've run into this myself. You install [GAT](http://www.guidanceautomation.net/) to play with it, create a package or two and then suddenly you can't uninstall the damn thing. Kzu explains why and tells you how to fix it.
  * [Gartner Talks About MS Recent Security Efforts](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2005/08/02/446729.aspx) - Michael Howard talks a bit about an article Information Week magazine about the Blackhat/Cisco issue where a Gartner researcher says some nice things about Microsoft's recent work on security. Cool. I can tell you from personal experience, security is taken very seriously in Redmond. Don't believe the FUD.
  * [CVS Camcorder Hacked](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/08/cvs_camcorder_u.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) - The "disposable" digital cameras have already been hacked and apparently it only took a few days for the new single-use digital camcorders from CVS to get hacked. No CVS near you? No problem. [Get one on Ebay](http://search.ebay.com/cvs-camcorder). I'm seriously considering ordering one and giving it a shot.
  * [Download Manager in Monad](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/ADownloadManagerInMSH.aspx) - Very cool... Lee Holmes wrote a cool little download manager in MSH. Lots of interesting MSH techniques to mine in there.
