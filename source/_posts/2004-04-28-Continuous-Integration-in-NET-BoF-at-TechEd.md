Just a reminder to go vote for your favorite [Birds of Feather](http://www.ineta.org/bof/) session if you are attending [TechEd in San Diego](http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/teched2004/default.mspx). [Kris Syverstad](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/) and I will be leading the group if it gets approved and it should be a fun talk. Hopefully we'll have demos of a running CruiseControl.NET system and maybe even a Draco.NET system. We'll see. 

Last I looked it was third in the voting list, so hopefully it will make the cut. 

You can vote [here](http://www.ineta.org/bof/). Note: The site is a little flaky, so click "Event Select" at the top first, then choose "Proposed Topics" to find my session. 

Thanks!
