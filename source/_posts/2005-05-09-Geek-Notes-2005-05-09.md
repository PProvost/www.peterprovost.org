I've said it before. I'll say it again. When you have little kids you will be sick more often that any other time in your life (except perhaps when you were a little kid).

But before I got whatever my kids had last week, I did have├é a good weekend with them. On Saturday the whole family volunteered at her school. We put in├é a "Butterfly Garden" which is basically a ton of flowers and stuff in new beds. It was fun. Yesterday, of course, was mother's day and we (me and Hadley) tried our best to pamper Emily all day. I think we only partially succeeded, but that's about the best you can do with a 3 year old accomplish and a hollering 10 month old.

At least we tried.

  * [Busy Box](http://blogs.crsw.com/mark/archive/2005/02/16/737.aspx) - A very cool alternative for a progress bar on a website. Looks to be very well done and feature rich. Check it out. [via [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000276.html)]
  * [More Super Cool Ruby](http://www.iunknown.com/CommentsWithEntry.aspx?EntryId=4e95ac83-c974-4318-a10c-92550a804f74) - John Lam seems to be playing with Ruby this year too. Like him I discovered the cool WIN32OLE class. However, I hadn't yet thought of how to wrap those objects to add new functionality. Then he takes it one further and shows [how to do a better "using" statement than C#](http://www.iunknown.com/CommentsWithEntry.aspx?EntryId=80525002-ef11-44e8-84f5-c479941cc1cf) has. Damn I love that dynamic languages can do things like that. (Now that we have IronPython, where is Ruby for .NET??)
  * [The Entomologist, The Redhead and The Dog](http://blogs.provost.org/emily/archive/2005/04/26/3308.aspx) - YesΓÇª my wife has posted more pictures of our family on [her blog](http://blogs.provost.org/emily).
  * [Where Does Unit Testing Fail](http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/02/09#ADTUnitTesting) - Mike Gunderloy interviews Mike Clark for ADT Magazine. Mr. Clark gives a great answer to this question that confuses people all the time. [via [Darrell Norton](http://codebetter.com/blogs/darrell.norton/archive/2005/05/04/62784.aspx)]
  * [Ada for .NET](http://www.usafa.af.mil/df/dfcs/bios/mcc_html/a_sharp.cfm) - The Deprartment of Computer Science at the USAFA has ported Ada to the .NET platform. Very cool. I think I first heard about this project a few years ago but they put out a new version last fall. They're looking for someone to help them write a VSIP package for VS.NET if you just love Ada and want to help out. ![](/Files/smile3.gif)├é [via [The Daily Grind #615](http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind615.html)]
