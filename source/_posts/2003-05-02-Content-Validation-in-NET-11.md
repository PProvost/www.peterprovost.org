A very interesting thing... in the 1.1 Framework, ASP.NET pages apparently scan posted data for potentially dangerous content (e.g. html tags)

Consequently, the content management system that I wrote for my company's site (and for a few customers) stopped accepting content edits. I completely recognize why something like this was built into the framework, but I would love some detail about what is allowed and what isn't. I hate finding out by trial-and-error.

At least there is a page directive (among other things) that turns it off.
