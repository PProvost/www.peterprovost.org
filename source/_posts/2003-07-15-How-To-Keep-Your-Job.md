Dave Thomas (of Pragmatic Programmer fame) has recently published [the slides from his talk](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/talks/HowToKeepYourJob/HTKYJ_Slides.html) "How To Keep Your Job". It always amazes me how few people take any time for personal education once they get a job. They go to work, do their job, and they go home. Very few people allocate any time for continuing education. Read this and pay attention, it is important.
