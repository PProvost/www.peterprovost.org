I don't know how he does it, but Mike Gunderloy ([Larkware News](http://www.larkware.com/)) seems to find more cool stuff than anyone I know. Thanks again to him for [finding this cool tool](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/SnatchingIcons.html)...

[IconSnatcher ](http://www.cdiware.com/cgi-bin/cdi.dll?site=1&class=1&page=iconsnatcher)scans a folder for .exe, .dll, .ico files. It then shows you all of the icons contained in them and lets you export the ones you want. This is so much easier than using VS.NET to open the .exe and yank out the icons. It even support transparency. I needed this two days ago!
