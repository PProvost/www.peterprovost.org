We're out of here. I'm taking the 5:05pm flight from Denver to San Diego. You can get me on any of the following IM networks: I'll try to be online as much as possible during the week. If it is anything like PDC, the only problem will be [finding power in the session rooms](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2003/10/26/874.aspx), not network connectivity.

As I mentioned before I will be working the Architecture cabana as part of my MVP duties. Here is my schedule for that as far as I know:

  * Monday 1:45-3:15pm
  * Tuesday 2:00-3:00pm
  * Wednesday Noon-2:00pm
  * Thursday 3:00-4:00pm

Please come say hi if you're in the neighborhood. I don't know exactly where the cabanas are, but you should be able to find them.

See you there!
