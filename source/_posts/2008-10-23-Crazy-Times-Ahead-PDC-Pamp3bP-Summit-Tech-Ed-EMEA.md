I don't know how I get myself into these things, but it looks like I'm hitting three conferences in three weeks, only two weeks after moving my family into a new house.

Foolish? Hell yeah. Fun? You bet!

[![Bling1](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/CrazyTimesAheadPDCPPSummitTechEdEMEA_11E5B/Bling1_3.jpg)](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/)I'm very fortunate this year to be one of the folks representing Visual Studio Team System Architecture Edition at the [Microsoft Professional Developer's Conference](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/) (PDC) in Los Angeles. PDC is always a special conference, because this is where we get to tell you what we've got coming up for developers. What is the next cool thing? Only one way to find out and that is come to PDC.

My talk at PDC is called "Architecture Without Big Design Up Front". It is a mix of agile development, architecture tooling, a little process, a real world problem to solve with real code (so made up samples here) and hopefully some fun.

[![PAG_Logo_NoText](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/CrazyTimesAheadPDCPPSummitTechEdEMEA_11E5B/PAG_Logo_NoText_1.png)](http://www.pnpsummit.com/) The week after PDC I fly up to Redmond to kill two birds with one stone: my monthly visit to my team in Building 25 on campus and a stop off at the P&P Summit to talk again. I always love the [P&P Summit](http://www.pnpsummit.com/) as a speaking gig. The audience is small, but not too small. The talks can be very interactive and you always get to talk about interesting things.

[![TechEd_EMEA_180_Speak_DEV](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/CrazyTimesAheadPDCPPSummitTechEdEMEA_11E5B/TechEd_EMEA_180_Speak_DEV_3.jpg)](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/teched2008/developer/registration/) The following week, I'll be in Barcelona Spain for [Tech Ed EMEA](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/teched2008/developer/registration/). I'll be repeating my PDC talk there for people who couldn't make it to LA, and I'll also be doing my classic "Agile Talk on Agility". (Thanks again to [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/) from whom I stole this talk years ago). My wonderful, amazing wife [Emily](http://blogs.provost.org/emily/) is coming along on this one (she never lets me go on trips like this solo), and it just happens to coincide with our 8th Anniversary, so we're going to do a little vacation while we're there.

Hopefully I'll bump into some of you on the road this tour. Please if you see me walking the hallways or in the hotel lobby or at one of the many social events, feel free to walk up and introduce yourself.

See you there!
