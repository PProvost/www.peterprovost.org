I haven't read the whole thing yet (appx. 100 pages), but the [Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](http://www.isecom.org/projects/osstmm.htm)&nbsp_place_holder;looks like a promising document. The idea of an open-source book is fascinating to me, and it seems especially appropriate in this domain. I'll try to post some kind of a review when I'm finished with it.
