I've got six invites to give away. To get one, please send me a technology-oriented haiku.

Please submit your poem via my [contact form](http://www.peterprovost.org/contact.aspx)├é I will post the winners and their poems in a day or so.

**UPDATE**: The [game is over](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/11/1975.aspx). There are no more invites. Sorry.
