I don't know about you, but I seem to run into HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) all the time. In the past 3 years I've had more than just a handful of customer asking me if my solution will be HIPAA compliant.

If you need to know what HIPAA is, don't read the 289 page [HIPAA regulations](http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/), read [this ](http://www.sans.org/projects/hipaa.php)instead. Then you can decide if you need to read the big book.
