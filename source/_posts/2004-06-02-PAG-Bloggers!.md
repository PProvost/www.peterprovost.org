How the hell did I miss this? I already had [Sandy Khaund's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/sandyk)&nbsp_place_holder;[[rss](http://weblogs.asp.net/sandyk/Rss.aspx)] on my blogroll, but while I wasn't looking [Scott Densmore](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore) [[rss](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/Rss.aspx)] started blogging. And now late last night (or was it early this morning?) [Jim Newkirk](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/)&nbsp_place_holder;[[rss](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/Rss.aspx)], of [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org) fame, started blogging.

I'm proud to know all of these guys and excited to see what they have to share.
