From [InkBlog](http://www.inkblog.com/2003/07/12.html#a49):

> The old favorite, Quake2, has been rewritten to run entirely inside the Common Language Runtime.&nbsp_place_holder; The good folks at [Vertigo Software](http://www.vertigosoftware.com/) did a great job on the port, even adding a Halo-like radar system to the game.&nbsp_place_holder; Source code is available too!&nbsp_place_holder; Go get [Quake2.NET](http://www.vertigosoftware.com/quake2) now and have some fraggin' fun!
> 
> Watch this blog this month for a big announcement regarding Gaming with .NET! (Yes, bigger than Quake2 :-)
