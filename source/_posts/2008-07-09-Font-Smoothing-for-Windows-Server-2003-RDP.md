A few days ago I posted [my recent love affair with a dark color scheme for Visual Studio](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/post/Dark-Visual-Studio-Im-hooked.aspx), but completely forgot to mention that using a Remote Desktop session to a Windows 2003 will not work very nicely with the Consolas font used by that scheme because the font-smoothing required by that font won't come across the wire.

Bryant Likes wrote a post about how to get around this over on his blog: [Font Smoothing for Windows Server 2003](http://blogs.sqlxml.org/bryantlikes/archive/2008/07/09/font-smoothing-for-windows-server-2003-rdp.aspx)

Thanks Bryant!
