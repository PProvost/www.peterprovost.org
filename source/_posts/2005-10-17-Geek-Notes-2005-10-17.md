I've been sick all weekend, but was feeling a bit better today and went to work. I got to participate in another of the planning sessions we're doing for our new workspace. Man it is gonna be cool. I can't wait to show you all the pics when it is done. Meanwhile, a few tidbits I had laying aroundΓÇª

  * [XP Stages of Acceptance](http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200510/20051012-XpStagesOfAcceptance.html) - Apparently Joel "I Hate Agile" Spolsky has [started doing things that sound very much like XP](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SetYourPriorities.html)ΓÇª to my eye it looks like he's finally moved from "offended" to "dismissive".
  * [Aliens Game for Monad](http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/09/aliensmsh_a_mon.html) - Adam Barr showed me this in the track lounge at PDC and now he's posted it. Not your typical use for a cmmand shell language, but it is a lot of fun to look at the code.
  * [BBOP User Interfaces](http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2005/10/bbop_the_ubiqui.html) - There are certainly significant differences between the UI for Excel and the one in TiVo. In this post, Jan Miksovsky coins a new term to explain the latter form.
  * [Jakob Nielsen's Top 10 Blog Mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html) - The usability guru tackles weblogs in this "top 10 mistakes" list. I think I do fairly well against this list. [via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/17/nielsens_top10_blog_.html)]
