The Holiday party season has begun for our family. We had our company party on Thursday of last week and the first of four consecutive family get-togethers was tonight. Whew! 

I'm currently reading Ingo Rammer's Advanced .NET Remoting which is an amazing book. I know I'm late on this bandwagon, but let me just say... don't do anything real with remoting unless you have read this book and everything on Ingo's site. 'Nuff said. 

  * [NAnt 0.84 RC2 Available](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=31650) - Just hit the streets today...
  * [Time Zone Conversion Classes for .NET](http://www.crankedup.com/code/) - This has been missing from the .NET BCL for way too long. [via Larkware News]
  * [Whitehorse Review](http://www.adtmag.com/article.asp?id=8667) - The modeling tool that ships with Whidbey is not based on UML because UML is too object oriented. Whitehorse will have a service oriented focus. Or so they say...
  * [Hilarious Japanese Metro Sign](http://www.ok-cancel.com/archives/post/2003/12/metro_sign.html) - Not very geeky, but damn funny. [via Jesse Ezell's blog]
  * [How Everyday Things Are Made](http://manufacturing.stanford.edu/) - A fun site with lots of interesting Flash movies. Chocolate, motorcycles, airplanes, jelly beans... [via [Randy Holloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/rholloway/posts/44322.aspx)]
  * [WinAMP 5 Available](http://www.winamp.com/) - I don't know when this happened, but I missed it. I gave up on WinAMP 3 but 5 looks very nice. Apparently it will play WMAs too, so I don't have to re-rip all my CDs.
