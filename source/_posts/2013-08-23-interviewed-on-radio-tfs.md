**Update 2013-08-29:** [We got mentioned][twc9ref] in This Week on Channel 9 today. Woot!

This morning I did an interview on [Radio TFS][radiotfs], hosted
by [Martin Woodward][woodwardweb] and [Greg Duncan][coolthingoftheday]. The
topic was "What have you been working on since Visual Studio 2012", and we had
a great time talking about all the cool stuff we've done in the VS2012 updates
and what we're targeting for Visual Studio 2013.

You can download &amp; listen to the interview here:  
[Episode 64: Peter Provost on Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate][showlink]

Many thanks to Martin and Greg for having me. It was fun and I'm looking
forward to doing it again so we can talk more about developer testing.
