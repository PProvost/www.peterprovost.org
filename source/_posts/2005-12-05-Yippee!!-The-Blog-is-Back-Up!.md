Whew. That was harder than it should have been.

It turns out that the half dozen sites I run on my WebHost4Life $9.95/month account were getting a little more traffic than I was really due for that level of service, so they _encouraged_ me to upgrade. No biggie, I make a few bucks in ads here and there, so I can afford it.

Everything was going swimmingly until I accidentally fat-fingered the DNS entries for provost.org and peterprovost.org. Oops. Very bad.

Now, about 24 hours later, it seems to be mostly fixed.

I sure wish I could forcibly "expire" a DNS entry. Oh well. Live and learn. Thanks for your patience!
