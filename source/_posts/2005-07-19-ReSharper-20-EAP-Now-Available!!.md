I've been pestering the JetBrains crew on their USENET forum for months now for this. ReSharper 1.x was not supported in VS 2005, but the new 2.0 EAP is finally supported!!

This is very likely to be early code, but I'm installing it now: [http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Download](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/Download)

I will report more info as I check it out.
