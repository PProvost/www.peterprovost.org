Not many posts lately. [Emily](http://blogs.provost.org/emily) has been out of town recuperating. [Grammy and Bompie](http://blogs.provost.org/grammyandbompie) (my folks) are in town helping me. So&nbsp_place_holder;I haven't been reading many blogs. And my Geek Notes output is directly proportional to how many blogs I read. But I see light at the end of the tunnel, soΓÇª

  * [How Do Managed Breakpoints Work](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2004/12/28/339756.aspx) - And older post from Mike Stall, but one all .NET developers should read.
  * [Apple iPodShuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/) - Check this out. The new iPod has no local UI and is basically on "Full Library Shuffle" all the time. The size of a pack of gum, it comes in either 512MB or 1GB mode. Also, while you're looking at Apple's newest stuff, check out the [Mac Mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/). An entire Mac in a box 6.5" square. Cool. [via [AaronX](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/)&nbsp_place_holder;and The .NET Guy]
  * [Frustration-Driven Language Development](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=43210) - I found this older Michael Feathers post after thinking about the question, "What does it really mean to say that a language supports testing?"
  * [Portable $50 Wi-Fi Detector](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/17/wifi_detector_shows_.html/) - "The Canary Wireless Hotspotter is a $50 WiFi detector with an LCD readout that shows the name, WEP status and signal strength of the 802.11g and 802.11b networks it finds." [via [BoingBoing](http://https://www.canarywireless.com/shop/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=1&cat=Wi%2DFi+Detectors)]
  * [Profiling .NET Applications with nprof](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/archive/2004/12/22/38226.aspx) - Darrell Norton gives us a nice little tutorial showing nprof. Remember this people: **Don't optimize until you have measured. Unless you use a profiler to tell you where to optimize, you are wasting your time**.
  * [MSW Logo](http://www.softronix.com/logo.html) - Ahh the good ol' [Logo Programming Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_programming_language). The programming language for the kid in all of us. Pen-up, pen-down. [via [The Daily Grind 524](http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind524.html)]

Also, I'll just throw this at the bottom. Google doesn't know who [Gerry Provost](http://blogs.provost.org/grammyandbompie) or [Sarah Jean Provost](http://blogs.provost.org/grammyandbompie) are or where they are on the 'net. This should help.

**Now playing:** [The Shins](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=The Shins) - [New Slang](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=New Slang&artistTerm=The Shins)
