I know [Chris Tavares](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/) mentioned this at work one day when I was at P&P, and I'm very excited that he blogged it and made it so easy to do. 

[The last vsvars32.ps1 I'll ever need](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/The-last-vsvars32ps1-Ill-ever-need.aspx)

I made one tiny modification, which is to default to 9.0 instead of 8.0 since that is the environment I use, but other than that it seems to work great. 

Thanks Chris!
