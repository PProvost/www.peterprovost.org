Thanks to [Larkware News](http://www.larkware.com/) for this nice little tool. One of the things that always impresses people who are new to .NET is how easy it is to create, test and deploy SOAP Web Services. When you show people the browser interface generated by the runtime, people just flip.

This interface is an excellent way to test simple methods, but it doesn't work very well for more complicated methods because it only supports HTTP GET. If you have a method that takes or returns a more complicated object/message, it won't help you.

[.NET WebService Studio 2.0](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=65a1d4ea-0f7a-41bd-8494-e916ebc4159c) wills the gap nicely. It will generate an easy to use form that you can use to populate a much more complicated message. This will certainly come in handy. If you use WSDL/SOAP much, you need this.
