After reading [Brad's post](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/004127.shtml), I decided that I had to go and try it myself. I don't know if this is good or bad, but my score was 69.55 against an average of 60.62. (Brad got 74.03... oh well.) To take the test yourself, visit the [CREAX Creativity Self-Assessment](http://creax.net/csa/frame.asp?session=zero) (requires Flash).
