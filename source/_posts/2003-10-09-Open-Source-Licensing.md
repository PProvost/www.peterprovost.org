NAnt is considering switching its license from GPL to something less restrictive. In my opinion, this is a very good move. I'm not a huge fan of the GPL. Way too restrictive.

Stefan Bodewig (long time contributor to Ant and member of the Apache Foundation) gives a nice├é analysis of the difference between the different licenses.

I like this description because it helps clarify what it is that I don't like about the GPL: I don't agree with its philosophical underpinnings.

Stefan continues...

> I for one don't agree with the FSF's vision, I feed my children from money I get for writing commercial software and I don't feel bad about it.
> 
> I enjoy writing software and giving it away for free as well - and if I contribute to a open source project that uses a BSDish license I get the additional benefit that I may use my own code (plus improvements made by others) for the commercial software I write.

Exactly. The FSF has tried to ram the GPL down many people's throats and I think a lot of young developers don't really understand the implications.

The reason I'm writing OpenPGP.NET from scratch is because the only open source implementation that I could find was GPL'd. I don't want to contribute to it because I would then be prevented from using that code (that I wrote) in a commercial application.

The GPL is way too socialistic for my taste. I tend toward a BSD or Apache license because I feel the restrictions they are adding make sense.

My 2 cents...
