The Client Team at patterns & practices is pleased to announce the release of the [Smart Client Software Factory](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/scsflp.asp). 

We'd like to thank everybody in [this community](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/scbat) for the feedback and participation. Special thanks to those who have closely followed each drop since we started and to our Expert Advisory Board. 

We really appreciate the time you invested in helping us identify high priority areas for us to work and steer the project in the right direction. 

What's next? Hands-On-Labs for Developers and Architects, a ClickOnce chapter, VB Guidance packages, and a few other surprises. 

Stay tuned and keep the great feedback coming!   
p&p Client Team
