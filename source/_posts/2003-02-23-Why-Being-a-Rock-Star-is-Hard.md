[This article](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/60991p-57008c.html) in the NY Daily News presents a hypothetical band and shows how much (actuall little) money they make in the new post-RIAA world. Basically for a gold record (500,000 copies sold) the gross is almost $8.5 million, but the 4-piece band only makes about $40,000 each. OUCH! This is why many bands these days care a lot more about touring than producing records.
