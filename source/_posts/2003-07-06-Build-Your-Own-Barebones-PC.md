Alvio is a new (?) online computer retailer that lets you completely build and customize a system from scratch. I agree with Chris, I always liked that Dell offered the customize feature, but you stil had limitations on what you could build. With [this page](http://www.alvio.com/smoreinfo.asp?iid=941), Alvio lets you configure everything... even the motherboard. [From the Marquee de Sells]
