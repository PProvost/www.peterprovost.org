I spent most of the weekend working on my slides for Win-Dev in Boston next month. I'm giving two talks, "Effective Unit Testing in C#" and "Refactoring Support in the Whidbey IDE". Should be fun. Hope some of you can make it.

  * [VPC Tip](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2004/09/07/2194.aspx) - Keith Brown reminds us that when running multiple VPC sessions, use an appropriate amount of RAM for each one, not too much, not too little.
  * [Microsoft Virtual Server Debuts](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1644199,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535) - Mary Jo Foley on Virtual Server 2005. I've been running it since early last week on my big dev box and I love it. I can term serv right into my development VPC images.
  * [Gray Area Social Situation](http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20040910.html) - This happens to me so often I can't even describe it...
  * [Full Length Feeds](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2004/09/11/228224.aspx) - They've pulled the full length feeds from weblogs.asp.net. I'm not a fan.

  * [.NET on Lego Mindstorm](http://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/services/weblog/) - This is cool, although I though the Mindstorm product line had been pulled... [via [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/12/1918221)]
