I've been dabbling with a rewrite of my scooter site: [Zundapp Bella Information Center](http://www.zbic.org/). The site was written at least 5 years ago using ASP, JScript and a mixed bag of Access databases and SQL Server. The problem is, I've got lots of features I want to rewrite using .NET but I just have too many other projects going on right now.

On Friday, a coworker showed me his new family site built on [DotNetNuke](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/). DNN is a portal framework built on the IBuySpy Portal Solution Kit. It has tons of features, an API for producing your own modules, and best of all, it is [free](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=125). (You can download the most recent build from the [DNN Workspace at GotDotNet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=15a33c40-46b7-45ac-b0a7-03ee52e72d5d).)

In less than an hour I had it up and running. An hour later and I had my navigation structures done and about half the content moved over. At that point I stopped to reoganize what I had done, but I was very impressed with how easy it was to use. The biggest dissappointment is that the code is all in VB.NET. I'm not a language bigot, I just prefer to work in C#. Oh well... Other than a quick recompile after installing a [photo gallery module](http://www.davidbarrett.net/default.aspx?tabid=22#gallery), I haven't really had to muck about in the code anyway.

Anyway, I hope to have the new ZBIC site up soon and DNN has made that possible. If you need a free content management/portal engine, you certainly should check it out.
