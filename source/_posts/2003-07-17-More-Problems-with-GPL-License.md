It sounds like some people are getting concerned about the LGPL now. I'm ranted about my dislike of the GPL before.

> According to [this post to POI-dev](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.jakarta.poi.devel/5900), Dave Turner (Mr License) of the FSF has decreed that the steps required to use an LGPL'd Java library will actually infect client code with substantial GNU-ness via Section 6 of the LGPL. (The "Lesser" GPL is supposed to protect only the Library, without infecting code using the library) This, as you might imagine, puts a few LGPL Java projects that previously thought they were embeddable without being viral in a bit of a bind. [Various](http://linuxintegrators.com/hl30/blog/general/?permalink=LGPL+clarification.html) [weblogs](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20030716#for_java_lgpl_is_viral) have [further](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1519.html) [coverage](http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/07/16.html#a56).
