I've been using the Pomodoro technique for a while now, using a set of OneNote pages as my tracker (one page per day). It works great, but until today I hadn't found a timer I liked.

Today I found [Pomodairo](http://code.google.com/p/pomodairo/), a nice little actively maintained client written in Adobe Air. This screenshot shows the timer window open with the task list expanded.

So far the only downside is the default volume of the alarm. The first time the ringer went off I just about jumped out of my chair. Fortunately there is a volume control in the settings.

If you've not heard of the Pomodoro technique, it is basically an agile project management technique for your personal daily tasks. You do iterations of 25-minutes with 5-min breaks in between. You work on only one thing at a time, and you track your time against plan.

I may write more about it later but the technique is well documented, with a free PDF download of the book, at [http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).
