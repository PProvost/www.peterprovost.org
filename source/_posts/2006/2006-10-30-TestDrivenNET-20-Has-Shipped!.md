[![](/Files/TestDriven.NET2.0HasShipped_A4FB/td_rocket25.gif)](http://www.testdriven.net/download.aspx) Wow. After years of work and headaches, my good friend [Jamie Casdale has just announced](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2006/10/30/TestDriven.NET-2.0.aspx) the version 2.0 RTM version of [TestDriven.NET](http://www.testdriven.net/default.aspx). 

It has always had a great feature set: 

  * Right-click and run the tests found in classes, fixtures, projects, solutions, etc. 
  * Run in the debugger 
  * Run w/ external runner 
  * Test failures go to Output window and Task list 
  * Double click on test failure and go straight to the failing test code 
  * Configurable key bindings for even easier running of tests

And now adds some very cool new things: 

  * Code coverage - NCover + Team Coverage 
  * Reflector support - 'Go To Reflector' functionality available on the Code, Disassembly, Call Stack, Modules, Project References and Solution Explorer windows. 
  * Repeat Test Run - Redo whatever test-run you did last

But I can't really do it justice, so check out [Jamie's post](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2006/10/30/TestDriven.NET-2.0.aspx). It has better descriptions, screenshots, and more. 

[Go get it!](http://www.testdriven.net/download.aspx) Come on... you know you want it.
