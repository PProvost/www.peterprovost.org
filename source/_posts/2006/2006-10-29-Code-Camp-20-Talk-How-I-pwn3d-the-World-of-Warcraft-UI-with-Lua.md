Today [Brad Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy) and I presented
this talk at [Seattle Code Camp
2.0](http://seattle.techevents.info/codecamp/2/default.aspx). Here is the
session description for those of you who didn't make it:

> World of Warcraft is arguably the most successful massively multiplayer game
> in history. Millions of players from hundreds of countries all playing
> together to kill monsters and each other. What could be more fun? Well, for
> many geeks one thing that is more fun is taking advantage of the very
> extensible nature of the user-interface by writing addons and extensions in a
> programming language called Lua. Join Brad and Peter for this fun session
> where you will learn how to bend the WoW UI to your will. (We promise to
> leave some time at the end for a little game-time demos and Q&A.)

As promised, here are a number of links to the information we discussed today.
I hope you enjoyed the talk as much as we enjoyed giving it.
