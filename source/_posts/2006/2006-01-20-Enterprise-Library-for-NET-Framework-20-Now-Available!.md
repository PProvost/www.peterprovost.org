Tom Hollander and team have shipped Enterprise Library for .NET 2.0:

> The long-awaited update to [Enterprise Library for .NET Framework 2.0 is now available](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp) - the official release is branded January 2006. This release of Enterprise Library includes six application blocks (Caching, Cryptography, Data Access, Exception Handling, Logging and Security), and provides similar functionality to the previous releases for the .NET Framework 1.1; however, Enterprise Library has been redesigned to use the new capabilities of the .NET Framework 2.0. 

Many congratulations to everyone on that team!
