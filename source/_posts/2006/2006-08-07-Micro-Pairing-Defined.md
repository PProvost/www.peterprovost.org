Last year I wrote a blog post titled, "[The Pair Programming TDD Game](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/08/29/7377.aspx)" where I described a way of doing pair-programming combined with TDD that changed the focus of the pair from one of "driver-navigator" to something more like "designer-implementer".

Since then [Brad Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy) and I have presented this concept (often with the help of our good friend [Mitch Lacey](http://blogs.msdn.com/mitchl/default.aspx)) a number of times around Microsoft and in other forums, most recently at the [Agile 2006 conference](http://www.agile2006.com/) in Minneapolis.

After that session (which was very well recieved) Brad, [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder) and I were talking and we decided that this technique needed a new name. A number of interesting proposals were named, but in the end the one I decided best described it was "Micro-Pairing".

So, from now on that is what we will call it. Brad and I have evolved the thinking behind this quite a bit from that first blog post, and will probably be writing more on it soon enough.

For now, here are a few write-ups and reviews of our Agile 2006 talk:

PS. For those who see a similarity to "[Ping-Pong Programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern),"&nbsp_place_holder;we acknowledge that but we are very clear to point out that Micro-Pairing is more like a subset of ping-ponging because it provides more prescriptive guidance about how to pair, when to switch roles, and the part negotiation plays in the process.
