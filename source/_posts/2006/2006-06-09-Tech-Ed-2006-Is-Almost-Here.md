I just wanted to post a quick note about TechEd 2006 in Boston. I arrive Sunday
afternoon and will be presenting ARC201 "Incorporating Agile Development into
Your Organization" on Monday morning with Alan Ridlehoover. Please come, we'd
love to see you.

Other than that I will be around, talking to customer, meeting people and
otherwise making a nuisance. Ping me via [TechEd
Connect](http://techedconnect.leveragesoftware.com/) if you want to hook up.
