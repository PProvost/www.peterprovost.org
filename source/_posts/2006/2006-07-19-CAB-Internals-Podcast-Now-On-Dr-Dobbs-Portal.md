A few weeks ago I was interviewed by the DDJ/Dr.Dobbs guys to talk about [CAB](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/cab), the [Smart Client Software Factory](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/scbat) and [Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/). 

Now, the [first of those interviews is live on ddj.com](http://www.ddj.com/dept/windows/190400301). 

Enjoy!
