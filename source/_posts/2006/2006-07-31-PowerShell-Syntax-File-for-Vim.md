After finally getting my machine setup back in order after and during the Agile 2006 conference, I realized that I hadn't updated my Monad/MSH syntax file to support PowerShell (ps1). 

The updates are done and I have [uploaded the file to vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1327). FWIW, the changes are almost none... just a replace of "msh" with "ps1" and all is well. After I use it some more, I will update it as needed. 

I will post some LUA-friendly installation instructions shortly, but for now you can use [my old instructions](/archive/2005/08/12/6812.aspx) (not-LUA friendly). 

Enjoy!
