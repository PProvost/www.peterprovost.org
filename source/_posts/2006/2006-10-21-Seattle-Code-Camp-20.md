Rather than write my own rendition of this post, I'll blatantly steal the relevant portions from [Brad Wilson's post](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/10/21/20405.aspx)...

> The first co-presentation is our [Micro-Pairing talk](http://seattle.techevents.info/codecamp/2/SessionInfo.aspx?ID=48b9da48-ede7-4f19-9559-18be93fcf259), which was actually born out of last year's Seattle Code Camp talk about Model-View-Presenter. It was an odd combination that seemed to work okay, but this talk will focus entirely on the Micro-Pairing agile practice (we used to call this "The TDD Pair Programming Game" until [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder/) suggested this better name). This is the same talk we did at Agile 2006 (in July) and the p&p Summit (a couple weeks ago), and this will likely be the last time we do this talk publicly.

> The second is titled [How I Pwn3d the World of Warcraft UI with Lua](http://seattle.techevents.info/codecamp/2/PresenterInfo.aspx?ID=d6aa8cb3-9f3c-4d37-bf5c-ee68ec71fc09). This is a new talk that we've never given before. We will discuss the topic of end-user extensibility in game development, and we'll teach you the basics of how to extend the game for yourself using a Lua/WoW Object Orientation library called [Ace2](http://www.wowace.com/). We don't want to give away too many secrets before the talk, of course. :) 

I always love presenting with Brad and I think these will both be fun. Please come out and participate, we'd love to see you.
