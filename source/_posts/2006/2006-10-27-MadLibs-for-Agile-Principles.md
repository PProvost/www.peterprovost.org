J.D. Meier, one of our PM/Architects, recently emailed around this questionnaire and I just noticed that he blogged it too. I originally replied via email, but decided that since he blogged it, I can too.

My answers are **_bold and underlined_** but the rest of this is from his email to me. (See [J.D.'s blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2006/10/19/using-madlibs-to-create-actionable-principles-practices.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;for his blogged version which is slightly different):

> [MadLibs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) can be an interesting approach to capturing or identifying principles, practices, values ... etc. 
> 
> Here's an example attempting to encapsulate principles of agile development: 
> 
>   * Write code to pass tests over **_writing code that you don├óΓé¼Γäót yet need. _**
>   * Measure progress by working software over **_measuring against a stale project plan._**
>   * Improve internal consistency and clarity of code through re-factoring over **_locking in the design before you know what you need._**
>   * Build releasable software in short time periods over **_shipping software too slowly to be relevant to the customer._**
>   * Close cooperation between the business and developers over **_eliminating conversations between those who know what they need and those who are able to provide it._**
>   * Respond to changing and emerging requirements over **_building what you thought you needed before you started._**
> 
> Of course, you can also leave off the front and contrast with the behavior you'd like to change
> 
>   * **_Evolutionary and emergent discovery of requirements and designs_** over document-centric practices.

I wonder how others would answer these... or what other sentences you might want to say instead?
