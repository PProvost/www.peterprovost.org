Tommy Williams has started posting an lists of translations from CMD.EXE to PowerShell. [His first post](http://twwilliams.com/blog/2006/07/30/translating-from-cmdexe-to-powershell-dir/) is the ever popular "DIR" command. Coming soon he promises a list of things you can do with PowerShell's "get-childitem" command that you can't do with DIR. (I already know a bunch of them, but I don't want to spoil his thunder. ![](/Files/smile1.gif)) 

You should subscribe to his [PowerShell category](http://twwilliams.com/blog/category/powershell/) to keep up with this project. Thanks Tommy!
