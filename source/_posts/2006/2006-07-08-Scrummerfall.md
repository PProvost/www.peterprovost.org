Thank you Brad Wilson for giving a name to a beast that we see all to often in the wild:

> **Scrummerfall**. n. The practice of combining [Scrum](http://www.controlchaos.com/) and [Waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_process) so as to ensure failure at a much faster rate than you had with Waterfall alone.

Read [Brad├óΓé¼Γäós post](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/07/08/16855.aspx) for more details.
