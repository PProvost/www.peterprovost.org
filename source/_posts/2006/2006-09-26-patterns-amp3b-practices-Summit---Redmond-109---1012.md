[Brad's post](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/09/26/19655.aspx) reminded me (and [Scott post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PatternsPracticesSummitWest2006.aspx) reminded him) that I forgot to tell you all that I'm speaking at the upcoming [patterns & practices Summit](http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2006.aspx) here in Redmond next month.

Here are my two talks:

  * **"The Agile Talk on Agility"** (co-presented with [Michael Puleio](http://blogs.msdn.com/mpuleio/)) is a style of talk that I first saw given by my friend [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder). Basically we will use agile project manegement techniques (mostly XP iteration planning) to define the content of the talk on the fly as we go. Learn about agile planning and learn about agile development at the same time.
  * **Micro-Pairing** (co-presented w/ [Brad Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/)) describes our refinement of the eXtreme Programming practices of Pair Programming and Test Driven Development into a fun development practices that feels less like work and more like playing. It encourages frequent micro-discussions about design and implementation direction to help you get the most out of your coding session.

There are [a lot of other interesting talks](http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2006schedule.aspx) this year and some [really great speakers](http://www.pnpsummit.com/west2006presenters.aspx), so I would encourage you all to register now and come out for a visit.

PS. If you ask really nicely, we may even give some tours of the new patterns & practices Agile Development Center.
