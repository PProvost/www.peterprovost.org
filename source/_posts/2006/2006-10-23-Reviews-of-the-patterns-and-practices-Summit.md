I just wanted to share links to a few people who blogged the _patterns &
practices Summit_ earlier this month. The conference was lot of fun, I met a
lot of interesting people and had a blast giving my presentations.

Thanks to everyone who came out to Redmond for this. I think it was our biggest
p&p Summit yet and I certainly enjoyed it. Hopefully the attendees did too.
