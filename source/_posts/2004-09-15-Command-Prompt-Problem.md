I've got an interesting problem with my Command Prompt in Windows XP.

I was playing around with the colors and now some color setting is messed up and I can't seem to figure out where to fix it...

There are some console apps that I run which produce output that is now displayed as yellow on a white background, where it used to display yellow on black.

I'm running my console green on black, and as you can imagine, yellow on white is almost illegible.

Does anyone know where the color information for the console is stored? I'm not talking about a shortcut here, I'm run it with Start | Run | cmd.exe.

Thanks!
