I don't know if I invented this application of this scubra phrase, but I seem to have used it a few times lately and people always know what it means.

**Buddy Breathing** [buhd'-ee breeth'-ing] -_noun_     The process where two people share a single power supply between two laptops, passing the cable back-and-forth between their machines as each battery runs out of power.
