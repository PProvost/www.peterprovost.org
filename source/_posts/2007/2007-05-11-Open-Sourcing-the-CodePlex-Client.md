The CodePlex team made [this announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/archive/2007/05/11/open-sourcing-the-codeplex-client.aspx) on their blog this morning: 

> This morning&nbsp_place_holder;we just published a [CodePlex project for our source control client](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlexClient). We've released the source code under the Microsoft Permissive License. The source code is already available, and the internal and external issues have been moved to the public [Issue Tracker](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlexClient/WorkItem/List.aspx). 
> 
> In addition to cpc.exe, we've also included a utility called tfc.exe, which works against arbitrary TFS servers. In the Beta 2 release of the client we will be publishing binaries for both cpc.exe and tfc.exe. The Beta 2 release will also enable the ability for cpc.exe users to get anonymous access to the source code of any project on the system, thereby closing a [long-standing CodePlex feature request](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=1359). 

Very cool! Get it!
