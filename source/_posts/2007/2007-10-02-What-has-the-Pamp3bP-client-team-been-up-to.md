I've been collecting these in my Inbox and figured they needed to go out here. As you may recall, before becoming a "suit", I was the dev lead for the Composite UI Application Block (aka CAB) and for the first P&P software factory, the Smart Client Software Factory v1. 

Here's what my old team has been up to lately: 

  * Announcing Web Client bundles

  * What has the Web Client Team been doing recently?

  * The Contextual AutoComplete Guidance Bundle is Available on CodePlex

Enjoy!
