My wife and I each have our most hated English language abuses. One of her favorites is "these ones" (you should omit the "ones" and just say "these"). One of mine is "I'm good" (it should be "I'm well" or "I feel good" because "well" is an adverb and "good" is an adjective.)

Anyway, for some reason last night I looked up "these ones" in Google and found this excellent [list of common english language errors](http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html). Take some time digging through it... you never know what you will find.
