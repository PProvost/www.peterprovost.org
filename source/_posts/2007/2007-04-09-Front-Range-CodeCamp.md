My good friend John Luif just pointed out that the [Front Range CodeCamp
v2.0](http://frontrangecodecamp.com/) is on the books for May 19 2007.

Code Camps are free technical conferences run by the local community for the
local community, so if you are in Denver or the front range region, think about
submitting a talk or at least attending.
