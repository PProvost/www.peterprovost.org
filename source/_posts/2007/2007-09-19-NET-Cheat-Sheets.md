I was looking to remind myself how to do milliseconds formatting for DateTime objects and ran across a few useful links and cheat sheets for things like that: 

  * [http://www.geekzilla.co.uk/View00FF7904-B510-468C-A2C8-F859AA20581F.htm](http://www.geekzilla.co.uk/View00FF7904-B510-468C-A2C8-F859AA20581F.htm)
  * [http://john-sheehan.com/blog/index.php/net-cheat-sheets/](http://john-sheehan.com/blog/index.php/net-cheat-sheets/)

The first had what I wanted in a comment at the bottom and the second just looks like it is useful to have around.
