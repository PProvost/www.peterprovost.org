I have a little text file I keep quotes and silly quips in. I've been collecting it for years. I recently installed a little program called Messenger Plus Live that lets you run scripts and do all kinds of other interesting things to Live Messenger. 

Long story short, there is a script for Messenger Plus that lets you have a database of quotes that rotate in your tagline in Messenger. I wanted my little text database in there, but it had its own XML file format. 

Powershell to the rescue: 
    
    
    $lines = gc 'quotes.txt'
    $dom = [xml] (gc 'quotes.xml')
    $lines | % { 
    $elt = $dom.CreateElement("sentence")
    $elt.set_InnerText($_)
    $dom.root.AppendChild($elt)
    }
    $dom.Save('quotes.xml')
    

God I love this thing! Who needs perl anymore? Not me.
