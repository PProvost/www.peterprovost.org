I used to use the [Microsoft Virtual CD-ROM](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe) tool, but the public one doesn't work in Vista. I also used Daemon Tools, but apparently it now bundles some SpyWare so I won't touch it. 

After a bit of digging today, I found this: [Mount and ISO Image in Windows Vista :: the How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/mount-an-iso-image-in-windows-vista/)

It works perfectly and is free. 

PS. I still don't understand why this isn't baked into the OS, but it isn't.
