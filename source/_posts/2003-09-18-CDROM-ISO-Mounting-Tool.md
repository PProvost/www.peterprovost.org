I don't remember who, but someone recently asked me for a Windows util for mounting an ISO image as a drive. I didn't know of one until today...

Brenton House (aka Dot Net Boy) posted [his list of free utilities](http://weblogs.asp.net/bhouse/posts/27986.aspx) and in there I found [Daemon Tools](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/) which does exactly that! Cool, thanks Brenton.
