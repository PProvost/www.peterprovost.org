&nbsp_place_holder;

We have just released another excellent guidance offering... this time focused on testing. Here is the abstract: 

> The patterns & practices Architecture Testing Guide is designed to help project stakeholders, software designers, developers, and testers understand the process of testing software architecture before the code is implemented. The paper describes an approach and methodology for testing the design of a system, and describes the user-specific viewpoints that you must consider during the testing process. The Architecture Testing Guide walks through the process of testing a system from each viewpoint, and provides instructions, examples, and best practices along the way. A draft version of the paper is for download here. 

You can [download it from GDN](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=4713168a-9073-40e2-854a-a4b9ca217de9).
