I just wanted to post this for anyone in the Denver/Rocky Mountain region who is working with SharePoint Portal Server or Windows SharePoint Services. Fellow Interlinker [Kris Syverstad](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/) has started a SharePoint User Group that will be having its first meeting at Interlink's Inverness office on Tuesday May 18th. 

For more information about this group, [contact Kris](http://weblogs.ilg.com/ksyverstad/contact.aspx).
