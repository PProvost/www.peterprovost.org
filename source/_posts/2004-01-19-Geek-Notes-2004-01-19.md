Have you ever noticed that if you copy a multi-line bit of text to the clipboard and then paste it into the Google Toolbar, the code in the toolbar strips the line breaks and turns it all into one line of text? This is invaluable for copy-pasting addresses into Google for a quick MapQuest lookup. 

But why doesn't IE (or any other browser for that matter) do this for the address bar? I'm sick and tired of having to "reassemble" multi-line URLs in notepad before pasting them into IE. I know there are plug-ins and other things to help with this, but Google figured out the answer on their first try. Why didn't anyone else?
