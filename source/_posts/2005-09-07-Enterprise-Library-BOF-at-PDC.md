From [TSHAK](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/tshak/archive/2005/09/07/132403.aspx): 

> The [EntLib PDC BOF](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/tshak/archive/2005/08/23/132098.aspx) you voted for has been accepted! It will be held on Monday, September 12, 2005 at 8:15 PM. When you register at PDC you should have a map that will indicate where the BOF sessions will be held. I hope to see you all there! 

I'll be there!
