Got my VS2K5 downloaded last night and am building up a VPC as I write this. Hopefully I'll find some time over the long weekend to get my hands dirty.

  * [XmlSerialization in Reflector](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/06/24/544.aspx) - I still can't believe how prolific Peli is with the cool Reflector Add-Ins. This one shows you what your class would look like if you ran it through XmlSerializer. Way cool.
  * [Effective NDoc and Stuff](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=909e3efd-c5f0-4e55-a2c0-d57fe0de90d9) - If your organization uses XML comments to produce MSDN-style documentation, then you need to read this post by Scott Hanselman.
  * [Book Review: Debugging the Development Process](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/archive/2004/06/25/17597.aspx) - Darrell Norton reviews a book I've been wanting to read. Now I want to read it more.
  * [Solvent](http://www.paraesthesia.com/blog/comments.php?id=602_0_1_0_C) - A cool little VS.NET Add-in to make VS.NET "suck less". [via [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=26bd94ef-0036-45dc-b5c5-d0cd86ddeae0)]
  * [Vil 1.1](http://www.1bot.com/download.html) - A code metrics and analysis tool. Unfortunately, it is crippled and won't work on assemblies with more than 100 classes unless you contact them for a key. I don't know if the key costs $$. [via [TheServerSide.net](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=26846)]
  * [Performance Characteristics of DataMappers](http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2004/06/25/862.aspx) - DonXML does a nice analysis of a few Data Mapper implementations and is surprised by the results.

And last but not least, check out [this beauty](http://www.apple.com/displays/)! A 30-inch LCD screen. Only for Macs right now, but that won't last for long. I still can't decide if I want that or [this three panel monster](http://www.digitaltigers.com/tigervista-powertrio.shtml)...
