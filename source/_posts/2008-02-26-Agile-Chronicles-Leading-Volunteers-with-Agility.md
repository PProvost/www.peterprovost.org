I found this nice article today in this month's Agile Chronicles: 

[Agile Chronicles: Leading Volunteers with Agility](http://www.agilechronicles.com/blog/2008/02/leading-volunte.html)

I found it particularly relevant because I am an officer in a club and have often felt that I could better apply some of the agile values to that organization and not just to my work as in software development. 

Enjoy!
