Sorry for the late reminder on this, but I have been so heads down on other project work that I completely forgot to post this.

I will be giving an all-day presentation/class titled "Building Quality .NET Solutions: All the other stuff..." three days in a row in Ft Collins, Denver and Colorado Springs.

Here is the abstract:

> A lot more goes into a successful development project than just designing the system and writing the code, but that is the focus of most developer training events. Very little attention is given to the other topics that enable a team to produce quality systems. In this session, you will learn about unit testing, build tools, continuous integration, source control systems, and other tools and techniques to improve your team's productivity.

And here are links to the Microsoft Events registration pages:

  * [June 17 2004 - Ft. Collins CO](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032253752)
  * [June 18 2004 - Denver CO](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032253753)
  * [June 21 2004 - Colorado Springs CO](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032253754)

Hope to see some of you there.
