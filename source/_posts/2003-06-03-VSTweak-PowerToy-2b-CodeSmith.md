This is cool. Let's assume you are using the CodeSmith custom tool to generate your code files on the fly. You have the .CST file in your project and all it well. You can open it and edit it, no problem.

But you don't get any color coding. Bummer.

But if you install [VSTweak](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/vstweak.exe), then you can add .CST as a "known" file extension. Tell it to open them as .ASP or .ASPX files and you get nice ASP-style color coding. Now if we could only figure out how to make it use Intellisense.
