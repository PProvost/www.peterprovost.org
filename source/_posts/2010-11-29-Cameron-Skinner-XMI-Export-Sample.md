Over the past couple of years demoing and presenting the VS2010 Architecture Tools and Extensibility features, one of the things that has often come up is a request for XMI Export. We added XMI Import in the [Visualization and Modeling Feature Pack](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460723.aspx), but the standard answer for XMI Export has been "roll it yourself, it isn't that hard". ![Smile](/images/blog/Windows-Live-Writer/2b50a40ad594/2CC2B878/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

Well, as [Cameron blogged this morning](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/camerons/archive/2010/11/29/xmi-export-sample.aspx), Steve Cook created a sample to get you started on just that. Cameron's blog explains it is detail, so head over there is XMI Export is something you've been looking for.
