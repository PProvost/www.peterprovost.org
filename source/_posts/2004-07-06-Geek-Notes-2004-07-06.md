Back to the grind... holiday is over.

  * [UserNameToken and Clear Test Passwords](http://pluralsight.com/keith/archive/2004/07/03/1532.aspx) - Keith Brows takes issue with how WSE 2.0 does username/password authentication. 
  * [NUnit 2.1 in VS2K5 Beta 1](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/07/05/173513.aspx) - Jim tells you how to do it. Not too hard and pretty much what I expected would work. 
  * [Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Guided Tour](http://beta.asp.net/GuidedTour/default.aspx) - This is a very nice article/tour/tutorial. If you have [downloaded the tools](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/vwd/), you should run through this. [via [Sam Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/07/05/12057.aspx)] 
  * [Virtual Laser Keyboard Review](http://davesipaq.com/articles/000063/ibiz_virtual_keyboard) - It is real now. You can actually order one. [via [Ted Neward](http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20040703#1088910793768)] 
  * [Clover.NET](http://www.cenqua.com/clover.net/) - It seems that this code coverage tool has finally shipped. Give it a try... How good are your tests? [via [TheServerSide.net](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=27132)]

Speaking of the virtual laser keyboard, I was chatting with [Bob](http://weblogs.ilg.com/brumfieldb/) the other day and he and I had an idea. We want a PC that is nothing more than a small box with a projector on one side, a virtual keyboard transmitter on the other side with a 4-port USB hub on the side. Make that sucker about the size of a Maxtor drive and now we're talking portable computer.
