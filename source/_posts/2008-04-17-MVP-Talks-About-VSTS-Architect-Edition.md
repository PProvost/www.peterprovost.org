I ran across [this post by Jeff Certain](http://blog.dotnetspeech.net/archive/2008/04/16/rosario-rocks-architecture-edition-again.aspx) on his blog talking about the Rosario release of VSTS Architect Edition. Sounds like we're moving in a positive direction: 

> I attended the Rosario Architecture Edition preview yesterday. Frankly, I'm two orders of magnitude more excited about this than I am about anything else I've seen here at the summit yet. 

Woot!
