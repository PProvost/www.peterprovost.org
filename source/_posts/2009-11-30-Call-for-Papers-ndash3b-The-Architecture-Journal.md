The Architecture Journal has just announce their call for papers for the 23rd issue, which just happens to be focusing on Architecture Modeling and its role in the broader SDLC.

If you've got something interesting you want to share, I encourage you to submit a paper idea and we'll take a look. I'm helping review the submissions, so make it good! :)
