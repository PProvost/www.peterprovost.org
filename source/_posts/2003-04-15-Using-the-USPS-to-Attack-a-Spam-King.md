If you are at all interested in security, you need to be subscribing to Bruce Schneier's [CRYPTOGRAM](http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html). You also should read his books.

Anyway, the topic here is spam. If you read my blog, you know I don't like it very much. Apparently a bunch of enterprising slashdot readers don't either. A number of them banded together and placed a DOS attack on a notorious spam-king. Apparently they signed him up for so many catalogs and other crap that he couldn't find his own mail in all of the junk.

I don't know how productive this really is, but I **LOVE IT.** My concern is that to a person who has made big bucks using spam as an advertising tool, this kind of publicity just proves that it works.
