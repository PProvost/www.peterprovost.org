The list of keyboard shortcuts for Remote Desktop used to be one click away in the System menu. Then it moved to the Help system. On my newest version, I can't find them at all.

Today I was trying to remember the shortcut for screenshot in RDP and couldn't find it. A quick internet search later, the answer was found. Crazy how sometimes the community support content is better and more discoverable that product help sytems.
