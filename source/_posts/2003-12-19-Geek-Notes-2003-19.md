Oops. It's been a while since I posted a Geek Notes. After seeing ROTK on Tuesday night, I've been too tired to do anything computer-related after work and my blogging has suffered. Sorry. 

We had our company holiday party last night and that was fun. My wife and I basically spent the entire evening following our 2-year old Hadley around the party. She was having a blast. 

  * [Windows XP Service Configurations](http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm) - Ever wondered which Windows XP services you really need? Which ones you shoud turn off? This is the most exhaustive list I've found. Enjoy!

  * [Anti-Pixel Style Button Makers](http://gtmcknight.com/buttons/) - Don't want to draw buttons for your weblog by hand? Here are a few tools to help you out.
  * [Amazon Browser in XUL](http://mab.mozdev.org/) - This is the coolest example of the power of XUL that I've ever seen. NOTE: You must be using Mozilla or Firebird to see it. Once there, click the "Start MAB Now!" link.

Right now I am in [K2.net Enterprise Workflow](http://www.k2workflow.com/) Training. In case you don't know K2 is an amazing human workflow engine for .NET. It generates .NET code, integrates with SharePoint, BizTalk or even your own applications. Very cool stuff.
