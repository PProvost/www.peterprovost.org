"AaronX" sent me [this Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6241-2003Jun17.html) quoting Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) saying that├é damaging someone's computer "may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights."

What a moron. I've been saying for years, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE KIDS when it comes to computer technology. Once this kind of behavior gets started, the kids will win EVERY TIME. Don't even get started. Find another way.
