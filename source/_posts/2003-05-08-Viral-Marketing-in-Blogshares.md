This is an interesting idea. Eric Kiel gave away thousands of shares to his blog [Cigarettes and Coffee](http://www.fullofnothing.org/)&nbsp_place_holder;in the hope that people would link to him and his stock price would go up.

Well, I linked to him. Hopefully his idea will work and my shares will go up in value! :)
