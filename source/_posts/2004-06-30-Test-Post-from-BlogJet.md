So on [ScottWater's recommendation](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2004/06/29/12371.aspx), I'm giving BlogJet a try and the only thing I can't do is "Post as Draft" and then later edit and publish.

Other than that, this is a nice little app. I may keep it.

UPDATE: I can't do any edits and republish. Too bad. Anyone else had luck with that on .TEXT?

UPDATE: It seems it was a problem in my .Text. ScottWater send me an updated DataHelper.cs that solved the problem. This will be fixed in the next release and has already been fixed on most public (e.g. weblogs.asp.net) servers.
