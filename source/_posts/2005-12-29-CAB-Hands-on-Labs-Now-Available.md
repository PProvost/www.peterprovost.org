Last night we finally posted the Hands on Labs for the December 2005 release of CAB. We think the labs are a great way to get up to speed on CAB and learn how to really build a composite smart client using the block. 

Many apologies to those who were waiting so patiently for this release. You can download the installer here: [http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c)
