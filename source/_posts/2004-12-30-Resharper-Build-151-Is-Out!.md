For anyone who uses Resharper, I just saw this go by on one of their newsgroups...

> We are glad to announce that we start early access program for new ReSharper   
version (1.5). This version will add more refactorings. We plan to release it in the end   
of January 2005. 
> 
> Here is the list of refactorings to be added: 
> 
> * Extract Interface   
* Extract Superclass   
* Introduce Field   
* Encapsulate Field   
* Copy Type   
* Introduce Parameter   
* Convert Interface to Abstract Class   
* Convert Abstract Class to Interface 

And even better... ReSharper build #151 is out.
