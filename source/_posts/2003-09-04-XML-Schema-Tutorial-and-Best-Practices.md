I'm helping a customer design a web service for their CRM product and I'm trying to use this as an opportunity to teach myself to do [WSDL First](http://www.capescience.com/articles/wsdlfirst/index.shtml)├é instead of the classic .NET way of letting the implementation generate the WSDL for you.

Of course the first step is in having a good understanding of XSD schemas. I have a pretty good grasp of the basics, but I was looking for some best├é practices and such. After searching through Google Groups for a while I found mention of [Roger├é Costello's xFront](http://www.xfront.com/) site.

If you are wanting to learn a bit about XSD development, head over there and do his [XML Schema Tutorial](http://www.xfront.com/xml-schema.html). Then review his [XML Schema Best Practices](http://www.xfront.com/BestPracticesHomepage.html).

Exactly what I was looking for.
