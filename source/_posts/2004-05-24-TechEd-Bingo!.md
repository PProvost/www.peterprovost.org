Datagrid Girl and ObjectSharp bring you...

**[TechEd Bingo!](http://www.techedbingo.com/techedbingo/default.aspx)**

[Print yourself a card](http://www.techedbingo.com/techedbingo/cards.aspx). Pay attention to the speakers in the sessions you are in. Mark off the words you hear and don't forget to yell out BINGO if you get a win!

Marcie says that on Tuesday she will have "pink bingo dabbers" for marking your spots.
