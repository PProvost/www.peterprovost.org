Yesterday evening the patterns & practices Enterprise Library Team hit another milestone on the way to the 2.0 release by publishing the [Enterprise Library 2.0 November CTP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/entlib2.asp). There are only a few things left to do before they ship the final bits, so go grab these and give it a try. 

For more information about this release and what is and is not in this package, see [Tom Hollander's blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2005/11/07/EntLibNovCTP.aspx) on the subject.
