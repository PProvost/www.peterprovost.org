Like many developers these days, I've really become hooked on using multiple displays. My new Dell Inspiron 8500 supports a second head on its external monitor port and combining that with a tool like [UltraMon](http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/) just makes it all work.

Then today I discovered the [Digital Tigers SideCar Plus Four Pro](http://www.digitaltigers.com/sidecar.shtml). This external box connected to a laptop via a PC Card and gives you FOUR more display surfaces. Combine that with a multiple monitor display like [this one](http://www.massmultiples.com/mass_multiples/c3h18_horizontal.htm), and you are flyin'!

Now where am I going to find the $5000 it takes to get this up and running? :)
