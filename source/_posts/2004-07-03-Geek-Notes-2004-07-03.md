Ahhh... the weather in Colorado is wonderful this holiday weekend. Mid-to-high 80s, nothing but parties and get togethers... not too much real work to do... I love it.

  * [System.Decimal Bug](http://pluralsight.com/craig/archive/2004/06/29/1502.aspx) - Craig Andera found an interesting bug in the .NET decimal class. It looks like they are using double precision arithmetic behind the scenes which is a no-no for a class that is specifically designed to avoid the rounding problems inherent in single and double precision numbers. I can't believe this wasn't found before now.
  * [Roadmap for Testing on an Agile Project](http://www.testing.com/writings/2004-roadmap.html) - The god of agile testing, Brian Marick, lays out how he would do testing if he were starting a new agile project.
  * [Continuous Integration and the Ambient OrbΓäó](http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/articles/169058.aspx) - Michael Swanson shows off a cool trick that gives a team immediate feedback on the state of their build server... using a glowing red/green Orb in the developer room.
  * [Free ASP.NET Controls](http://weblogs.asp.net/erobillard/archive/2004/06/30/170053.aspx) - Eli Robillard found some sweet free web controls.
  * [Using Fancy XPath With XML Documentation](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/06/30/598.aspx) - Yet another jem from Peli... this time a way to use XPath to select all source code examples that include a class rather than just the example defined for that class.
