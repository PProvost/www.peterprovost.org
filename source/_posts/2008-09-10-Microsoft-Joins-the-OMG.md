[![uml_small3](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/MicrosoftJoinstheOMG_962F/uml_small3_thumb_1.gif)](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/MicrosoftJoinstheOMG_962F/uml_small3_4.gif) I've been eagerly waiting to share this with all of you, but since [the press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/sep08/09-10OMGModelingPR.mspx) hit the wire this morning, we can now let the cat out of the bag.

This morning we announced that we have joined the Object Management Group (OMG). The OMG is the group that owns a number of standards, including UML and BPMN.

As we announced at Tech Ed this past spring, Visual Studio Team System code-name "Rosario" Architecture Edition (aka Team Arch), will be shipping UML designers in the box. The opportunity to participate and engage with the standards setting body for UML is very exiting for all of us.
