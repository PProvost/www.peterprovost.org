You all know that I [play with Linux a bit](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/04/30.html#a271), but this is an excellent little trusim that the anti-Microsoft community tries to hide:

> _"'Enterprises now realize that they are writing to a distribution, not to Linux in general. What works on Red Hat Advanced Server will not work on SuSE Linux,' Schwartz [Sun's executive vice president of software] said. ... There is little doubt that the notion of 'Linux and free have gone away. Red Hat's pricing model now makes that clear,' he said."_

Not free and not portable.
