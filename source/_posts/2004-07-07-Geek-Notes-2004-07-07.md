I haven't blogged this much, but my wife is due to be induced for our second child (a boy this time) tomorrow afternoon. Consequently, I probably won't be blogging much after that... except to post pics of the kid.

  * [Shadowfax Wizards and Code Generation](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/07/05/173238.aspx) - kzu gives us a simple walkthough of some of the Shadowfax wizards and shows off the code generation engine.
  * [SOA Area on MSDN Architecture Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/soa/default.aspx) - The .NET Architecture Center is getting better and better... more stuff here than you can read in a week.
  * [Interview with the Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/06/24/pragmatic_programmers.html) - I'm a huge fan of Dave and Andy's work. Their book The Pragmatic Programmer is something that all developers should have on their desks. [via [simplegeek](http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/db35df14-c44a-420c-897a-96d2beb539f0)]
  * [System.Transactions Overview](http://weblogs.asp.net/angelsb/archive/2004/07/06/174215.aspx) - Angel Saenz-Badillos shows us some snippets of how the new ADO.NET distributed transaction stuff works. Mmmm mmmm good. [via [Sam Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/07/06/12064.aspx)]
  * [Using System.Transactions Pt. 1](http://weblogs.asp.net/angelsb/archive/2004/07/07/175586.aspx) - And if that wasn't good enough, here is some more good stuff from Angel.
  * [Friends Don't Let Friends Browse the Internet](http://donxml.com/grokthis/archive/2004/07/06/899.aspx) - DonXML thinks we should all kill our browsers and start reading (via RSS) instead. Not a bad idea, but I don't think it will catch on.
