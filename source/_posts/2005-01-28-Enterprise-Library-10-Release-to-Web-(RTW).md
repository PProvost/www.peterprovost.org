All right folks, it is coming. Be patient, it takes a little bit of time to actually get it from our (the developers') hands and up to the MSDN download page, but it is on its way.

The best way to keep track if this, and to get educated at the same time is to read Scott Densmore's blog. Scott, who&nbsp_place_holder;is the dev-lead on EntLib, posted [the official announcement](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2005/01/19/356040.aspx) a few days ago, and this morning started what promised to be a series of posts about the inner workings of EntLib.

I'll keep this page updates with links to his posts&nbsp_place_holder; as he makes them and of course I will provide a link straight to the MSDN page when it comes online.

Scott's Posts:

  * [Enterprise Library - Shipping Dedication](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2005/01/28/362404.aspx) - Scott has dedicates his efforts to his daughters Lizzie and Anna.
  * [Enterprise Library - A Comparison](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2005/01/28/362411.aspx) - A glimpse into what Scott thinks of Enterprise Library
  * [Enterprise Library - Configuration Part 1](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2005/01/28/362579.aspx) - Scott starts to show you the best part of EntLib (IMHO)
