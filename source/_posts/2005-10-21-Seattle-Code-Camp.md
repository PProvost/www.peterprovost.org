Probably a little late for most of my readers, butΓÇª

I'm presenting (or co-presenting) four talks* at [Code Camp Seattle](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/) this weekend. All four talks are on Sunday:

  * [Monad: The New Microsoft Shell](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/sessions.html#monad)
  * [Dependency Injection: What, Why and How](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/sessions.html#dependency_injection)&nbsp_place_holder;(w/ Brad Wilson)
  * [TDD for GUIs Using Model/View/Presenter](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/sessions.html#tdd_gui) (w/ Brad Wilson)
  * [Composite UI Application Block](http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/sessions.html#ui_cab)

The TDD talk should be fun. Brad and I are basically gonna go up there and play the [TDD Game](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/08/29/7377.aspx) in front of an audience. Should be fun.

* - Yeah. Four. You see, I've never done Code Camp before and I'm used to submitting 3 or 4 presentation ideas to a conference, expecting them to pick 1 or 2. Well, apparently at Code Camp, if they have room, they take 'em all. Lesson learned. ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile1.gif)
