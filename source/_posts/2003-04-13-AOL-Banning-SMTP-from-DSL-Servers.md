This one certainly goes in my wife's "What The?" category. AOL has decided that an appropriate way to combat spam is to deny all incoming email from servers that are hosted on DSL connections. This is a violation of the RCFs that relate to SMTP not to mention not being very nice...

I still think that the only way we are going to see any solution to the spam problem is the widespread adption of a new way to handle the delivery of email. I [have talked about](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/03/15.html#a110) the [Receptionist Protocol ](http://whitelist.com/protocol.html)before and I'm still very interested in how that works itself out. Rather than trying to stop spam from being sent, we just need to prevent it from being delivered.
