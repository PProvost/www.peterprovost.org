I know I've been kinda quiet since moving to VSTS Team Architect, but getting settled into a new job and moving your family can be a bit time consuming. 

However, I was taking a break looking at some blogs and stuff and found a few people talking about some of the new stuff in [our most recent CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=65D0E3BD-9DF3-421A-804F-8F01BD90F0B4&displaylang=en)! 

Very cool indeed and I wanted to share them with you.

It got me excited to see people talking about our new stuff. I promise I'll be writing more about it soon... just give me some time.
