So I've got enough horsepower on my new dev box to run my VPC development environment (yes I still do [that](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2003/11/10/923.aspx)) in Virtual Server 2005. Very nice. Now I can leave that giant machine in my office and work from anywhere I want (using my laptop) by using Remote Desktop. All the convenience of a laptop with the power and extensibility of a desktop box.

As a side note, I still can't get BlogJet to work from campus. Please someone tell me they know the answer... the BlogJet support people don't seem to be able to help. I'm very bummed.

  * [Weeding Out Bugs](http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/DebugWeeding.rdoc) - Dave Thomas provides another metaphor in his (and Andy Hunt's)   
"programming is like" gardening idea. This time around... debugging is like weeking. +1 [via [Brian Marick](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2004/08/23#weeding)]
  * [A Song for Mr. Sells](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7962.aspx) - I think everyone blogged this, but it is just too funny to pass up. Go [listen](http://www.neopoleon.com/music/burning_man.mp3) to Rory sing an ode to Chris Sells.
  * [Developing with Least Privilege](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3bd44801-21b2-44a5-8d60-1d03e81b2ec9) - I'm really going to try this time... honestly.
  * [Dingo Schema Compiler](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=28470) - An alternative to XmlSerializer/xsd.exe. Could be interesting.
  * [Is Optimization Refactoring?](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IsOptimizationRefactoring.html) - Martin Fowler says no. I agree, their puposes are completely different even if the techniques are similar.
