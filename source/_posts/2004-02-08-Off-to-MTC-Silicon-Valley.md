I'm off to the Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) in Silicon Valley tomorrow morning for a 2-day Architecture Design Session (ADS) with a large client. I'm optimistic. We'll see, though... I've had people say to me, "Bring a book," implying that I would be bored. I sure hope not.

I don't know if I'll have any connectivity while I'm there, so probably no blog entries until I get back.
