If you've been wondering what new features will be in the next version of SQL Server, codenamed Yukon, then you should read [this interview with Euan Garden](http://www.itwriting.com/sqlyukon.php). Euan is the Product Unit Manager for SQL Server Tools and covers XML, XQuery, CLR support and gives us a little bit of info about the new Reporting Server (which should ship for SQL 2000 by the end of the year).
