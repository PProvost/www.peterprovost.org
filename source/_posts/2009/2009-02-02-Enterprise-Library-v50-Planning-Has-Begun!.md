[![PAG_Logo_NoText](/images/blog/PAG_Logo_NoText.png)](http://www.codeplex.com/entlib) Way back in 2004, sitting in the "delta lounge" team room with Scott, Brian, Ed, T-Shak, Rohit, Prashant and Mani, I never would have believed that almost 5 years later, we'd still be shipping [Enterprise Library](http://www.codeplex.com/entlib) (aka EntLib) or that we'd be up to version 5.0.

A few days ago, my good friend Grigori Melnik, who is the PM for EntLib over in Patterns & Practices, sent me an email reminding me that they are looking for planning input on the version 5.0 features.

He's written it all up over on his blog:

If you are a current or past EntLib user, please don't miss this opportunity to help steer the product. As I tell my wife, "If you don't tell me what you want, you shouldn't expect me to get you the right thing."
