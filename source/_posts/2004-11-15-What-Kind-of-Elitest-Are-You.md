Apparently, I'm a "Book and Language Snob." So is [Brian Button](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/oneagilecoder/). [Scott Densmore](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore) is&nbsp_place_holder;a Music Provenu. What kind are you?

You speak eloquently and have seemingly read every  
book ever published. You are a fountain of  
endless (sometimes useless) knowledge, and  
never fail to impress at a party.

> What people love: You can answer almost any  
question people ask, and have thus been  
nicknamed Jeeves. 
> 
> What people hate: You constantly correct their  
grammar and insult their paperbacks.
