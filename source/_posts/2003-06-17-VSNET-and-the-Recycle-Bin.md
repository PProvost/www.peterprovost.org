Boy did I get lucky. I was tired and not really paying attention. I'd had the code checked out for too long because of network problems. I needed to split my web project into two. After creating the new one (with the same physical location as a subfolder of the old one), I then deleted the files from the old one.

Guess what? I deleted all of my edits. Ugh.

At the last minute, right before smashing my head into the wall, I decided to take a look in the Recycle bin. Believe it or not, they were there. I can't believe it. Thank you VS.NET team.
