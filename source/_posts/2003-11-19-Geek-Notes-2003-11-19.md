This is my first Geek Notes posted from NewsGator, so hopefully it will work well. I'm also experimenting with NewsGator's Draft capabilities... 

  * [Obsolete in Whidbey](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/permalink.aspx/4b6b11db-ff4c-451c-8588-627c7dad085d) - Brad Abrams has posted a [preliminary list of what will be obsoleted in Whidbey](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/brada/ObsoletedInWhidbey.htm). This list is VERY subject to change, but should help you see what parts of the BCL to avoid moving forward.
  * [ASP.NET Popup Control](http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/asppopup.asp) - This is a very cool little control that gives you MSN Messenger style popups in your ASP.NET application. You can see an online demo [here](http://www.eeeksoft.net/files/popuptest). [via [Clarke Scott](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/ClarkeScott/posts/3716.aspx)]
  * [ASP.NET Connection String Tip](http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/travisl/posts/550.aspx) - Carter's Dad posts a nice little trick for managing connection strings in ASP.NET applications. Be sure to read the comments for the whole thing...
  * [Virtual PC 2004 Available on MSDN Downloads](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/downloads/) - Of course you need to be an MSDN subscriber to get it.
  * [MSN Newsbot](http://newsbot.msn.com/) - Microsoft has released a beta of its version of Google News. Looks to be UK only right now.
  * [Lonestar Screenshots Posted](http://kstati.com/tabula/posts/794.aspx) - An early look at Windows XP Table PC Editon 2004.
  * [ASP.NET Request Validation Exploit Discovered](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8562/discussion/) - Looks like this doesn't work as well as MS had hoped.
