![Agility (Binshou) Kanji](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/ScrumofScrumsHaiku_B717/Agility%20(Binshou)%20Kanji_3.png) My Scrum of Scrums has   
Become something other than   
What I want it to be

It should be simply   
A coming together of   
Technical people

Instead it becomes   
Like a management review   
I lieu of sharing

What did you do since?   
What will you do until we?   
Is something blocking you?
