I've never played around with a metal detector before, but last night I had to find something personal (small round jewelry) that had been lost in the backyard the day before. My wife and I were very unhappy that it was missing, so finding it was high on the list of things to do when I got home from work.

As I said, I haven't used a metal detector before, but I had seen plenty of beachcomber types with the headphones and the long metal wand walking the beach near my dad's old house in St. Pete Beach FL. I fired up the detector and played with the settins for a while before starting out into the backyard.

These things aren't easy to use well, but they ain't that hard either. Needless to say I found the thing we were looking for in less than an hour. Given that we have almost half an acre back there, I was pretty happy. +1 for metal detectors!
