I love juggling. I'm not very good but I want to be. I've got [JuggleSaver](http://www.jugglesaver.co.uk/) as my screensaver. I've been playing with [MAGNUS](http://www.juggling.org/programs/java/MAGNUS/) to try to learn more about site-swaps. I've spent too much time reading all the information on [juggling.org](http://www.juggling.org/). I've got a set of clubs and balls at homeΓÇª and another one at work.

So&nbsp_place_holder;yesterday when I read on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/24/some_interesting_vid.html) that the [World Juggling Federation Championships](http://www.jugglingcompetition.com/) is being shown as five separate half hour shows on ESPN2 starting tomorrow, I got a little excited. They are showing:

  * Advanced Ball Competition
  * Advanced Ring Competition
  * Advanced Club Competition
  * Team 6 Competition
  * Team 7+ Competition

The TiVo is set!!

If you like juggling, visit theWJF site and watch [the ESPN commercial](http://www.jugglingcompetition.com/ESPN2_PROMOA.mov). Very cool.

**Now playing:** [Rush](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=Rush) - [2112- I: Overture/II: The Temples of Syrinx/III: Discovery/IV: Presenta](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=2112- I: Overture/II: The Temples of Syrinx/III: Discovery/IV: Presenta&artistTerm=Rush)
