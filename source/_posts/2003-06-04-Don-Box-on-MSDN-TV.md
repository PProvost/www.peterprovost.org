Don Box has [an episode of MSDN TV](http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=26E214A0-07B7-4132-8AFD-EE8F5E84E731&displaylang=en)&nbsp_place_holder;about using XPathNavigator. If you read his blog, it isn't particularly new stuff, but it was nice to hear him talk about it. Also, I think he explains WHY XPathNavigator is better than other choices in a way that makes more sense than what I've heard before. Good stuff.

BTW, did anyone else notice that Don was using emacs? I thought [he gave up on that](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx#nn2003-05-07T05:30:30Z)? :)
