We've started looking at properties in Seattle and the market doesn't look too bad if you're williing to drive a bit.

  * [IBM vs Microsoft on UML and Stuff...](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=27769)&nbsp_place_holder;- A set of articles and interviews discussing software lifecycle models have come out talking to Grady Booch of Rational about Microsoft's Team System product, and Rick LaPlante, Microsoft's general manager of Visual Studio Team System. It's an interesting back-and-forth about Team System and its goals and ability to achieve them.
  * [RipDigital.com](http://www.ripdigital.com/) - [Scott Hanselman just ripped his whole CD collection](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2cc53d8e-fab8-424e-b080-81f69b6da086) to DVD using this service. At $500 for 500 CDs, that seems a bit expensive to me.

  * [Rich and Fruity Sauce](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7469.aspx) - Rory is on a roll lately... this is so damn funny... just go read it.
  * [Painfull NAnt Lessons](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/08/06/435.aspx) - Kris Syverstad shares an embarassing and painful situation where his unit tests got commented out of the continuous integration NAnt script for SIX WEEKS. Oops.
  * [Unzip Pipeline Component for BizTalk](http://martijnh.blogspot.com/2004/08/decompression-pipeline-component-zip.html) - This is cool. I wonder why there isn't also a ZIP version?
