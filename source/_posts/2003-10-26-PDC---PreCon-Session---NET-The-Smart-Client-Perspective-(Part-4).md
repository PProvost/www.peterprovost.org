Remoting, remoting, remoting, remoting.

For the last hour Rocky has been talking (remember that he is a VB guy) and
Chris has been driving the keyboard. The constant back-and-forth banter between
them is absolutely hilarious.

For example, after one exchange where Chris was talking about how you don't
have to add a reference for one of the Remoting DLLs in C# (or something like
that), Rocky spouts out, "So as you can see, C# is optimized to do it the slow
way while VB is optimized to do remoting the fast way."

Much laughter ensues...

Seriously though, Rocky's intro to remoting was probably the best simple
remoting explaination I've seen. He showed how to get up and running with just
10 lines of code. Then he showed how to bring in location transparency, remote
activation, etc. Excellent job Rocky.

What he hasn't covered (yet) is how to make the decision between the many
different kinds of remoting (e.g. single call, singleton, CAO, etc.) or how to
decide between remoting and web services.
