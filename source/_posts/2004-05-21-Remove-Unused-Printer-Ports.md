When I'm travelling around visiting clients, I often end up connecting to one of their local printers by creating my own TCP/IP printer port. But after a while, you end up with all of these damn ports and no way to get rid of them (that I could find).

Google to the rescue! I found [this page on TechNet](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/scriptcenter/printing/scrprn12.mspx) that had the following script on it. Works like a charm!
    
    
    Set objDictionary = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
    strComputer = "."
    Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:" _
        & "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")
    Set colPrinters =  objWMIService.ExecQuery _
        ("Select * from Win32_Printer")
    For Each objPrinter in colPrinters 
        objDictionary.Add objPrinter.PortName, objPrinter.PortName
    Next
    Set colPorts = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
        ("Select * from Win32_TCPIPPrinterPort")
    For Each objPort in colPorts
        If objDictionary.Exists(objPort.Name) Then
        Else
            ObjPort.Delete_    'Yes that underscore matters!
        End If
    Next
