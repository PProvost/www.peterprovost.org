Wow. MS has released 2.0 of their Java Language Conversion Assistant, which converts Java to C#. From the MSDN site:

  * **Project conversion.** This release converts Java Server Page (JSP) and servlet applications, as well as Windows Foundation Classes (WFC) and Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) client-side applications. 
  * **Applet projects.** Applet support has been increased. It's now easier than ever to convert applets to Windows user controls for hosting in the browser. 
  * **Additional API support.** Java-language code using the 1.2 Collections API is now converted to the equivalent .NET collection classes. 
  * **Localized application support.** The Java Language Conversion Assistant can now both read and write Unicode and localized applications. In addition, users can also convert code using several popular file formats. 
  * **Performance.** The performance of the Java Language Conversion Assistant is now significantly improved for the conversion of large projects.

Impressive. Servlets? JSP? AWT? Nice.
