Here is the nice thing about [my Blogshares strategy](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/05/28.html#a372)... every now and then you get a HUGE win. Back when I started it, I sold 1250 shares of something that I bought for $1 each for $100 each... more than $100,000 profit in one transaction.

Today I did even better than that with two shares... $450,000 PROFIT in two transactions.

If only the real market worked like this.
