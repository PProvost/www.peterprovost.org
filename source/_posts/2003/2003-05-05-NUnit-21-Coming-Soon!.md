Some of the new things include a much cooler and more responsive gui, various option settings, the ability to load and test multiple assemblies, the ability to save and reload test projects with support for multiple configurations, opening Visual Studio projects directly and more accessible information about individual test results in the gui._

But some things present hard problems: GUI, multi-threading,&nbsp_place_holder;etc. What can we do about these? This talk is based on material that's part of my tutorial "[Advanced Unit Testing Techniques for .NET](http://www.xp2003.org/tutorial/poole.html)" being presented at [XP2003](http://www.xp2003.org/) in Genoa this month and also for the book I'm working on. I'll outline some key tricks that apply&nbsp_place_holder; everywhere and show some code for specific issues__."_

Excellent! I know a number of people have emailed me asking about running testing in multiple assemblies, so I'm sure that will be happily received. It will be interesting to see how this release overlaps with the features provided in [NUnitAddIn](http://dotnetweblogs.com/NUnitAddin/).

I sure wish Charlie was coming to Denver to speak at XP Denver!
