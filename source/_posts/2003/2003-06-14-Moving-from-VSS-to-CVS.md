I started [a thread on WinTech Off Topic](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/20052) a few days ago asking for people who have moved from VSS to CVS to please give any insights they have. The primary difference between the two is unquestionably the difference between checkout-edit-checkin in VSS and edit-merge-commit in CVS. I've pretty much got that down at this point.

For people who don't read WTOT, but do read my blog, if you have experience making this transition, please email me or post it in the comments to this item. Thanks.
