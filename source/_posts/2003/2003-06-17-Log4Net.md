> [Using log4net](http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/06/16/log4net.html) - Introductory tutorial from Nauman Leghari. I'm still trying to figure out why log4net is superior to the built-in Trace and Debug classes, but I'm probably just a Philistine who doesn't appreciate open-source software. 

I'll tell you one thing that I really like about log4net over the built in classes. I get complete control over what is logged and where it is logged to from the config file. Which means I can say things like this AFTER deployment:

  * FAIL events will be emailed to the QA dept
  * ERROR events will be logged to the NT Event Log
  * DEBUG events will be ignored

But during development I probably had something like this:

  * ALL events will be logged to a SQL Database (or a text file, etc.)

Personally, I love it.
