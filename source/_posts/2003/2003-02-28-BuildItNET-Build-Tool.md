Has anyone else taken a look at [BuildIt](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=b32497b0-77f7-4831-9c55-58bf3962163e)? The blurb on MS-Downloads says, "_BuildIt.NET is designed to jump-start the build process used for development of .NET distributed applications._"

I just downloaded it. I'll let you know what I think.
