I'm in the middle of restructuring most of the content in this blog. I'm trying to set it up as more of a content management system, which means I need to reorganize some of the older content and enter some content that used to live in other places (like my wiki).

Sorry. Please ignore the stuff you don't like. It'll be over soon. :)

UPDATE 2004-05-01: And now I'm undoing all of that because .TEXT supports what I wanted better than dasBlog did. Oh well...
