I just read [this post on News from the Forest](http://pinetree-tech.com/weblog/archives/2003/03/15.shtml#000238) and at this point, I must agree with Justin. For the most part, object prevalence isn't quite ready. Bummer. It will happen someday though...

I'm wondering if I'm really gonna care once we all start using Longhorn's SQL based file system...
