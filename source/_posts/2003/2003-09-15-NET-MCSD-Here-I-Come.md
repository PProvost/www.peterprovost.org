I've posted before about my complete lack of interest in certifications for software developers. (Except maybe the IEEE Certified Software Development Professional which I don't yet have...)

But... my new employer will pay me to update my MCSD from VC++ 6.0 to .NET, so why not? Took my first test ([70-300](http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-300.asp)) on Friday and passed. Now my boss is challenging me to take the other 3 tests ([70-315](http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-315.asp), [70-316](http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-316.asp), and [70-320](http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-320.asp)) in ONE DAY.

I need to think about that for a couple of days before deciding. That might be an interesting way to get my bonus money but it could be a boring ass day. We'll see...

PS. Has anyone else noticed that they don't give you the scores anymore? Just pass/fail? Bummer.
