I just finished re-reading [a long thread on Slashdot about Identity Theft](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/12/2113218). It is something I've been thinking about for a while. I mean, I have a firewall on my home network and run 128-bit WEP on my wireless, but I don't do anything to protect myself from identity theft. Why not?

So I decided to try to learn a little bit about how you can protect yourself. Some of the funniest responses in that Slashdot thread are people saying the best way to avoid identity theft is to fuck up your credit so bad that nobody wants your identity. Good point, but not the solution I'm looking for.

I found [this site](http://www.fightidentitytheft.com/) which seems to have a bunch of different information, but I don't know what their motives are. The first thing I wanted to know is [how do I put a fraud alert on├é my credit report](http://www.fightidentitytheft.com/flag.html)? After that I was interested to read on /. about putting a password on my bank account. Are there any other things that I'm missing? Is there a better site for this kind of information?
