From the DotList website:

> Features
> 
>   * Command-line interpreter with Read-Eval-Print Loop 
>   * Embeddable Interpreter object in a DLL assembly 
>   * Lexically scoped, Lisp-1 
>   * &key, &opt and &rest parameters 
>   * CL-style Macros 
>   * Generic functions (single and binary dispatch) 
>   * .Net type system (strings, ints, floats, bools, chars, arrays etc are the .Net System types, no conversions/mapping) 
>   * Transparent access to the .Net framework - simple syntax for constructor and method invocation and property access 

This could be interesting. Especially the embeddable interpreter. I know Lisp has been used as a scripting language in the past. It could be an interesting choice for .NET applications.
