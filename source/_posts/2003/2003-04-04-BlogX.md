Well, it appears that [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx?key=2003-04-04T10:03:19Z) and [Harry Pierson](http://www.devhawk.net/default.aspx?date=4%2f4%2f2003#66)&nbsp_place_holder;are both moving to [BlogX](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a)&nbsp_place_holder;as their blogging engine. Good move. I paid for Radio about a week before I discovered BlogX, so I'll probably hold off for a little while longer, but I'll almost certainly move over their soon.
