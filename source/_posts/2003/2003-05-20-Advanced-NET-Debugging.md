A couple of useful documents from MSDN:

  * [SOS: It's Not Just and ABBA Song Anymore](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/06/Bugslayer/default.aspx) - This article introduces you to SOS (Son of Strike), a very powerful set of debugging tools included in the 1.1 SDK.
  * [Production Debugging for .NET Framework Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/DBGrm.asp)&nbsp_place_holder; - 170 pages of advanced, real-world debugging guidance. Must read.
