The previous tutorials and such about Office 2003 Smart Documents have been pretty poor, but [this one](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnofftalk/html/office09042003.asp) looks pretty damn good. This tutorial is for VB.NET, but you should be able to translate it into C# if you want.

It should be very interesting to see if this technology really takes off or not.
