Ives Tuyaerts hosted this session and it was better than the last one for a couple of reasons:

  1. There were less people so it was more interactive
  2. A few people got very involved in the discussion
  3. Jim Newkirk (the author of NUnit) was there :)

We had a lively discussion about the good and bad things of unit testing in .NET. I was excited to meet Jim and chatted with him afterwards. He is an quiet but engaging person who feels very passionately about what he does. And, without a doubt, NUnit rules.
