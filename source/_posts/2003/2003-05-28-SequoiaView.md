[SequoiaView ](http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/)is a very cool tool that shows you graphically where your disk space has gone. As soon as I fired it up, I realized that I had an old SQL database that was holding down 10% of my drive. I don't need it anymore, so I dropped it. It would have been a pain in the ass to identify that without this tool. Thanks to [Fabrice ](http://www.dotnetweblogs.com/fmarguerie/)for [telling us about this](http://dotnetweblogs.com/fmarguerie/posts/7680.aspx).
