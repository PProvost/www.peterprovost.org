SharpReader is a very nice new news aggregator by [Luke Hutteman](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/). It is certainly worth a look if you are trying to find a perfect Windows-based RSS aggregator. I still haven't tried Harvester, yet so I may switch again.

I suggested a few things to Luke:

  * Config for default refresh
  * Minimize to system tray

Then about 13 seconds later I realized that it does minimize to the systray, it just does it with the close button instead of the minimize button. I think that is a bit counter-intuitive, but I can learn...
