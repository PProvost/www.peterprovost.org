From the webpage:

> _The Toolbox library for the .NET Framework offers helper methods and types for many diverse areas, including enhanced functionality for Windows Forms classes; manipulating locked bitmap data; validating character strings; new dictionary collections; sending e-mail using Simple MAPI; mathematical functions inspired by Fortran 90; and more. _

Sounds like a nice little collection of utilities. Combined with [Genghis](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/genghis/) and the [Typed Collection Generator](http://kristopherjohnson.net/TypedCollectionGenerator/1.3.0/TypedCollectionGenerator.htm), this will give you a serious collection of code tools for .NET.
