Spent the last 5 days in Vail on our company's annual management retreat. (Who me? Management? Yeah, right.)

Anyway, I got back to a full work Inbox, a fuller (sic) personal Inbox and an absolutely massive pile of unread posts in my RSS aggregator.

Whew! I'm working my way though the RSS, SpamBayes cleaned up 95% of my personal Inbox and I spent this morning catching up on work email. Maybe I'll be caught up by tomorrow... we'll see.
