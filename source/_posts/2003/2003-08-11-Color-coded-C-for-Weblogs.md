I know a lot of people were talking about the [TripleASP.NET Code Formatter](http://tripleasp.net/showcode.aspx) a few months ago, but sometimes I'm slow...

I've been very annoyed by code posting lately, so I'm going to try it out and see if it works for me.

Here is an attempt using some code from an earlier post:
    
    public void SetPassword( DirectoryEntry entry, string password )
      
    {
      
       // There should be a blank line after this...
      
    
      
       entry.Invoke("SetPassword", password );
      
    }  
    

Not bad. I think I'll start using it.
