About 9 months ago, I was working on a project that had to print high quality maps on an 11x17 printer. One of the many problems we ran into was figuring out how to accruately determine the printer margins for the selected printer. We were working in .NET and it didn't seem possible.

We did eventually figure it out, but boy a sure wish this article had existed then. It would have saved me a lot of time.
