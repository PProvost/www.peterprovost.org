Is anyone interested ([Brad](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/)?) in putting together a [Pragmatic Practitioners group](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?PragmaticPractitioners) for Denver? I recently discovered this idea and was surprised that there wasn't one here already.

Leave comments if you are interested (or if you think it is stupid).
