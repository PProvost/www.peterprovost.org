Roy beat me to it. I was going to try the [Caching App Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/CachingBlock.asp) from a WinForms app this weekend to see if it would work. It does and he [talks about it here](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/posts/23813.aspx).
