Well, it is almost 4am Wednesday morning and I just├é got home from the ROTK opener. Man, what a great movie. The war sequences, and there were a lot of them, were absolutely amazing. I've never seen anything quite like it before. All in all,├é an excellent conclusion to an excellent trilogy.

I haven't quite decided how I feel about the ending though. I don't want to post any spoilers for anyone, so I won't say much more right now.
