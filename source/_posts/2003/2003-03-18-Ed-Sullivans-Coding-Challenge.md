I can't believe I haven't heard of [this one](http://dotnetweblogs.com/Whaggard/Story/3638.aspx) before:

> _For years, we gave the same programming test to every developer. It was a straightforward test that required no setup or external knowledge from manuals. The candidates were asked to write a program that could print its source to the screen exactly, without performing any file input._

I like that. I think I'll use that with the next developer I interview.
