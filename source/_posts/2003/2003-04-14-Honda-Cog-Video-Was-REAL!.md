Apprently, the COG video which has been floating around the net (and which [I talked about earlier](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/04/03.html#a185)) [was real](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/page.cfm?objectid=12844132&method=full&siteid=89488&headline=TAKE%20606)! Ok... their is 1 second of CGI in it, but all of the rest of it is real. In addition to the link I posted before, here is the official one. Take a look and see if you can figure out where the CGI is. Try it before you read [the article](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/page.cfm?objectid=12844132&method=full&siteid=89488&headline=TAKE%20606)...
