As a CodeProject junkie, I remember when this first came out. The tutorial posted there dealt with creating stored procedures though and didn't really catch my interest. Now that I'm looking at it closer, I realize that I've been missing out.

CodeSmith is a generic tool for producing code from templates. But it does more than that. It can generate code by analyzing your database schema. You gotta play with this.
