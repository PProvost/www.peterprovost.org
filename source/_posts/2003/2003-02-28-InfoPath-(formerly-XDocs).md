I've been reading the occasional post in blogspace about this thing, but until I read "[Clemens takes the red pill](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx#nn2003-02-28T05:22:42Z)" on [Don Box's Spoutlet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutletex.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;I didn't really understand why I cared.

I guess now I need to go find myself a copy... :)
