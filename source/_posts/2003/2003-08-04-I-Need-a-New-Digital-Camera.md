My wife and I have been saying this for a while, but now I'm really convinced. With a little bit of [photoshop wizardry](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-blending.shtml) and camera that knows how to take bracketed exposures, you can make photos that are unbelievable.

I just have to try this out. Thanks to [John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/) for [pointing out](http://www.iunknown.com/000307.html) this cool technique.

Anyone want to recommend a camera? I've been told to get a Canon PowerShot G3 but it is a bit expensive. John Lam uses a Nikon CoolPix 5700 but it is even more expensive that the G3. Isn't there something in the $300-$400 range that is good?
