If you are writing Windows Forms apps and aren't aware of [Genghis](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/genghis/), then you better go download it now! The Genghis Group, a team of developers led by [Chris Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com), has been putting this together for a while. It has a lot of very useful classes including:

  * Completion Combo 
  * Command Line Parser 
  * Wizard Framework 
  * Much more!
