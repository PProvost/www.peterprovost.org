I just made a quick scan through [What's New in Exchange 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=84236bd9-ac54-4113-b037-c04a96a977fd&displaylang=en) and noticed that Outlook Web Access (OWA) seems to have been made a first class citizen. I've been told that a number of people inside the Big House use&nbsp_place_holder;OWA instead of Outlook, but I always found it to be lacking.

Here is a screenshot of the new OWA from the document:

Other notable improvements to OWA:

  * Support for rules
  * Signatures
  * Junk Mail
  * Tasks
  * Color Schemes
  * Context Menus
  * Improved Keyboard Shortcuts

On the development side, it looks like they haven't made many improvements. A couple of updates to WMI, but not much else.
