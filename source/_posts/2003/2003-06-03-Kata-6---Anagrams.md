[Pragmatic Dave](http://pragprog.com/pragdave) has posted [the sixth installment of his Programming Kata series](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSix.rdoc,v). In this exercise, you are asked to produce a program that find anagrams. This is similar to a program I wrote when I was 11 that helped me solve the jumble puzzles in the newspaper.

Now go practice! Wax on, wax off.
