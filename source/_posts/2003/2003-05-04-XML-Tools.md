A nice little set of XML Tools from GDN:

  * XML Diff & Patch
  * XSD & XDR Schema Validator
  * XSD Inference

Of these three, the last tool is probably the most interesting. You feed it an XML file and it infers the XSD schema. Feed it more files and it refines that inference and improves the XSD.
