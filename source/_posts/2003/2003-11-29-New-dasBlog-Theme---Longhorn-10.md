Those of you who read this weblog on the web instead of via an RSS feed have already noticed that I posted my new theme. This theme is based on Longhorn's Slate Theme.

I'll be working on it as I discover things that don't work the way I expect them to, but it is good enough for me to have posted.

The entire thing is done with CSS, there are no tables in the theme. The only tables are those generated by the dasBlog macros. This CSS focus creates some problems (duh) but I had to try it. I may end up re-writing it using tables if I can't resolve all the problems. We'll see.

Please leave me a comment if you love it or hate it. I appreciate your opinions.

Thanks!
