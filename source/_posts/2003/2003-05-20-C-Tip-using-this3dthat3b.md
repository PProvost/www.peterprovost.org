Here's something I didn't know I could do in C#:
    
    using webctrls = System.Web.UI.WebControls;  
    ...  
    protected webctrls.Label label1;

Cool. Don't need it much with the BCL, but sometimes you can get an occasional name ambiguity with 3rd party libraries and this can make it a little easier to deal with.
