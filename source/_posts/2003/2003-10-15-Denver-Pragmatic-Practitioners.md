Well, it has begun. Monday night [Gordon Weakliem](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/), [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/), [Greg Reinacker](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/) and myself got together for a planning meeting over beer at the Park Meadows Rock Bottom Brewery.

We put together a tentative plan for how we will make this thing work. We are hoping to get Dave Thomas to join us in November, so once I get confirmation from him I will post a message telling when and where we will meet.

I have created [a page for our group](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?DenverPractitioners) on [The Pragmatic Programmers Wiki](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?HomePage). Please keep an eye on that page for details.

I will post an announcement here when we have a date for the next meeting.
