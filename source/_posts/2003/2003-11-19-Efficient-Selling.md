I just ran out to McDonalds to grab a bite and I decided to go through the drive-thru. When ordering, the attendant asked me "cash or credit". Credit I replied. 

Then when I rolled up to Window #1 I handed her my card. She swiped it and handed it back to me with a reciept that she had already printed. No authorization, no waiting for the reciept to print, no signing. Wow. That is fast. I almost didn't have to stop the car.
