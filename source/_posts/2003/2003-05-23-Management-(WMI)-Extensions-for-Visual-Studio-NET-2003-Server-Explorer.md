Not enough people are putting WMI into their applications, but if you are someone who does, then you'll want to know about [this](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=62d91a63-1253-4ea6-8599-68fb3ef77de1&displaylang=en):

> This component adds WMI-based management extensions to the Visual Studio .NET Server Explorer tool through two new nodes, Management Classes and Management Events. Management Classes allow the developer to browse and modify WMI data as well as invoke methods. Management Events enable the developer to register for WMI events. Data and events can be easily added to an application being developed.
