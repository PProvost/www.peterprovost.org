I just got home from seeing Trey Anstasio (front man for Phish) at the Fillmore here in Denver. Good show. Highlights for me were First Tube, a ROCKING cover of Led Zeppelin's Dazed and Confused and the encore, Dire Straits Sultans of Swing. I love Trey's version of Sultans because the Knopfler lead guitar riffs are played by the horn sections instead of the guitar. Sounds very cool. If you care, you can [see the entire setlist here](http://www.phantasytour.com/trey/shows.cgi?showID=106).
