A colleague of mine sent me a link to Mike Walsh's WSS FAQ:

[http://wss.collutions.com/default.aspx](http://wss.collutions.com/default.aspx)

From there I also found Stephen Cummins SPSFAQ site:

[http://www.spsfaq.com/](http://www.spsfaq.com/)

Good sources of information for anyone playing with SPS 2003.
