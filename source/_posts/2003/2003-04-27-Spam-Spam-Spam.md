I'm disappointed that [Cloudmark SpamNet ](http://www.cloudmark.com/products/spamnet/)looks like it is about to become a commercial product. It has always been free, and I don't know if I could survive without it. Does anyone know of any other free Outlook plug-ins that work well? I get lots of spam and need help... 1100 junk emails in the last 18 days.
