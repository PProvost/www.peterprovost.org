So I looked down at my systray and the [SharpReader](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056) icon had changed from green to yellow. "What the?" I asked.

It had new messages for me. So yet another "feature" that [I asked for](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/04/07.html#a203) was already there. Nice job.
