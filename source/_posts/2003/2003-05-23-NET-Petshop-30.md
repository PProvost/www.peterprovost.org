MS just shipped the .NET Petshop 3.0. I haven't downloaded it, but I wonder if they've made any improvements to the database schema? Here is what it says on the download page:

> PetShop 3.0 .Net Sample Application that demonstrates an enterprise architecture for building .NET Web Applications. The application can be used to compare to Sun Microsystem's J2EE Pet Store application across architecture, programming model, productivity, performance, scalability and reliability. The new .NET Pet Shop 3.0 incorporates community feedback with an improved architecture that follows Microsoft Prescriptive Architecture Guidelines, and will be benchmarked by the Middleware Company in June, 2003 to compare with several J2EE implementations of the same application. The new .NET PetShop 3.0 implements a Data Access Layer against both SQL Server 2000 and Oracle 9i backend databases.

Sounds good. It'll be interesting to see the TMC benchmark.
