Sorry I didn't post anything over the weekend. My daughter wouldn't let me on the computer. Everytime I picked it up she got annoyed and started hollering "Dada!" at me. :) 

  * [Sun 3D Desktop](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/xtreme/) - Check out this video demo of the new Sun 3D Desktop. Move windows around in 3D space. Interesting, but I don't really know if I need it. I wonder if the Longhorn team will feel the need to copy this for the next version of Windows. 
  * [Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) - In this essay, Paul Graham talks about the relationship between computer programmers and artists. Good read. 

Busy busy busy...
