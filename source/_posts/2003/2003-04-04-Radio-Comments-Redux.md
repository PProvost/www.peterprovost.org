I'm still not happy about how Radio handles comments. For me to tell if anyone has left comments on my blog, I have to switch out of "my" view and into the public view. Bummer.

Also, yesterday and today the Radio comments engine has been down, causing JavaScript errors on my public page. More bummer.

Can anyone suggest an alternative comment engine?
