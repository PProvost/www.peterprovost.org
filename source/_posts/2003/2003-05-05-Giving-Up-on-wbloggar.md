I tried, but it just didn't work out for me. I have a few specific problems with w.bloggar:

  1. Apostrophes get handled badly. I don't know if it is w.bloggar or Radio, but every apostrophe I use in w.bloggar becomes the text "&apos;" instead of the entity "&apos;". Very frustrating. I use contractions a lot. 
  2. Can't add item link. Maybe I can, but it certainly isn't obvious. 
  3. Primitive WYSIWYG support. I'm lazy. Let me see what I'm typing. 
  4. No built in <p> support. I want line breaks turned into <p>.

If anyone can help me with these problems, I'll try it again.
