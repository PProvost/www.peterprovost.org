Has anyone else seen the [Master Pages ](http://www.asp.net/ControlGallery/ControlDetail.aspx?Control=385&tabindex=2)way of doing ASP.NET templates? [Paul Wilson ](http://dotnetweblogs.com/pwilson/)wrote [an excellent introduction ](http://aspalliance.com/PaulWilson/Articles/?id=13)to them at ASPAlliance.com. He then[ took it one step further ](http://www.aspalliance.com/PaulWilson/Articles/?id=14)and improved them a bit. Nice work Paul.

Here's my question... can we really expect to see this in ASP.NET 2.0? As an approach I suppose it is just as good as [mine](http://www.bespoketechnologies.com/Resources/ASP.NET%20Page%20Templates.pdf)&nbsp_place_holder;(which I've taken about 20 steps further in real life than in that article), but I am trying to plan for the future... if I were to start a new project, should I use Master Pages so I'm heading the right way when 2.0 comes out?

Does anyone have more information on how page templating will work in ASP.NET 2.0?
