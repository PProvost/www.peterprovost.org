This is a very interesting argument. I've dabbled in XHTML for a while and I generally like the way that XHTML Strict makes me structure my site, but after reading this, I have to wonder if I should be using it or not.

We all know that ASP.NET doesn't produce valid XHTML without tons of work, and of course you could follow the same CSS + Scripting in HTML 4.x that you have to follow in XHTML, so maybe this point is moot. It certainly is going to make me think twice about doing XHTML (as text/html) in the future.
