OK. So my last post was a bit negative. I just love what CSS promises and am continually disappointed when I try to do anything cool with it. It is so annoying to use table for complicated layout.

Regardless, I went ahead and redid it with tables. [Here](http://www.peterprovost.org/OutlookProtoScreenshot.gif) is a screenshot of my html prototype. The problem now, as I see it, is going to be making [dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net) work like the prototype works.

What I'd like is to have the reading pane only display one posting. To display an entry in the reading pane, you select it from the list in the middle pane (or something like that). I suppose I'll need to do some serious digging in the [dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net) code to make this work. Oh well... maybe some day.
