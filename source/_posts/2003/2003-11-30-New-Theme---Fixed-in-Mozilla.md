Thanks to Brad (aka [DotNetGuy](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/)) for pointing out that my new theme doesn't work in Mozilla. I had yet to install it on my new machine, so hadn't tested it. I should have suspected that all that CSS wasn't going to work cross browser.

CSS is one of those things that I come back to every now and then... and get burned by each time. It works well for style formatting (e.g. fonts, colors, etc.) but it absolutely SUCKS at layout. What works in IE doesn't work in Mozilla and vice versa.

They should just pull all the positioning stuff out. Needless to say, I converted it to tables this morning to make it work.

Ugh.
