Has anyone out there run into&nbsp_place_holder;a homeopathic remedy called [Frequency Specific Microcurrent](http://www.cemmed.com/fsm_intro1.htm)? A co-worker of mine went to the doctor for a legitimate medical problem and because her normal practitioner wasn't in, she had to meet with someone else.

This person (apparently a medical doctor, but we aren't sure) suggested that my friend have a session of FSM because it would help her out.

This absolutely infuriates me. I can't stand the continued promulgation of this kind of pseudo-science crap. Especially by a ligitimate medical practitioner. Just because our insurance companies have started accepting accupuncture and chiropractic as medical alternatives doesn't make them good science. People are being confused by their government, by the press and now by people who should know better... their doctors.
