Well... they weren't there this morning. Or when I got back from my late morning meeting. Finally, after 5 more calls today, they showed up at about 3pm. It took them another hour to solve it. Now we're up. Got I hate the telecoms. I'm so weary of the whole thing I can't even think of anything witty to write.
