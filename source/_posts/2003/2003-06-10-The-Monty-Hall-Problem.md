[Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/) [posted a C# demonstration](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/003396.shtml) of the classic [Monty Hall Problem](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.monty.hall.html). I remember getting into a huge argument with some of my co-workers at a previous job and I basically did the same thing. I sat down and busted out a quick program that played the game. I think it was in VB3 though... :)

The most interesting thing is to see people in Brad's comments arguing that this isn't real. That it is a hoax or something. It isn't. It worked EVERY TIME. Probabilities don't lie.
