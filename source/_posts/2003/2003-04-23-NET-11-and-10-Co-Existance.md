Im wondering if anyone has had any issues running the .NET 1.1 Framework and the .NET 1.0 on the same server? I have a customer who is hosting at [ActiveHost](http://www.activehost.com) and they won't install 1.1 on their existing production machines. They are telling us that if we want to use 1.1, we have to switch to a different server. And, it won't be available for another week or so.

I'm running 1.1 and 1.0 on all of my machines and haven't experienced any problems. Are they just being paranoid?
