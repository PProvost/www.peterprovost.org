Thanks to [Larkware News ](http://www.larkware.com/)for pointing this out. A bunch of people on [ASP.NET ](http://www.asp.net/)have been _[having problems](http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowForum.aspx?tabindex=1&ForumID=91)_ builing the [IE Web Controls ](http://www.asp.net/IEWebControls/Download.aspx)in VS.NET, but in [this article ](http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20030426.asp)Peter Bromberg shows us what to do. He also helps us all out by providing a [compiled help file ](http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/IEWebControls.chm)(.CHM) for them.

Nice work.
