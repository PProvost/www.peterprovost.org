I've heard that [some people are having problems](http://dotnetweblogs.com/sgentile/posts/6442.aspx) getting w.bloggar to run on Win2K3, but I'm up and running just fine. Granted I'm using Radio so my server is the local box, so the network problems they are having probably aren't happening for me.

I also installed the [WMPAmplog plugin ](http://www.minimalverbosity.com/2003/April/29/introducing_wmpamplog.htm)and it seems to be happily picking up my current audio track from WinAmp. Nice.

Now I just have to decide if I like editing my weblog this way. We'll see. I have to admit that I'm kind of lazy about my weblog and I like the WYSIWYG crap that Radio has. But since I'm pretty sure I'll be bailing on Radio one of these days, I thought I should at least take a look at another posting system.
