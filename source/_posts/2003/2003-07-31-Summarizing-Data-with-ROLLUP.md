In [this article](http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/073003-1.aspx) at [4GuysFromRolla.com](http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com), Dave Long show us how to use the SQL ROLLUP clause and some fancy DataSet manipulations to get summary totals into a DataGrid.

I remember ROLLUP from my SQL Implementation exam, but I have to say I haven't used it much. I also seem to remember COMPUTE, but I've never used that.

Anyway, if you don't know about ROLLUP, you should take a look at this article. Takes 5 minutes to read and puts another tool in you kit.
