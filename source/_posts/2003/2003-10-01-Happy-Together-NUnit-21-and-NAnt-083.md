Many thanks to John Lam for [showing us how to patch](http://www.iunknown.com/000342.html) [NAnt 0.8.3](http://nant.sourceforge.net/) to work with [NUnit 2.1](http://www.nunit.org/).

I had just downloaded NAnt 0.8.3 last night and ran into this very problem. Now I don't have to figure it out myself. Isn't it strange how things work out that way?
