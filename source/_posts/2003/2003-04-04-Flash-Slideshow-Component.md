Wow. This sure saved me a lot of time. I'm certainly not&nbsp_place_holder;a Flash expert, although I have played around with Flash MX scripting a bit. I was just getting ready to write a Flash MX component to do a slideshow that I needed for a customer when I found [this](http://www.actionscript.org/tutorials/intermediate/Easy_Slideshow/index.shtml). It is very easy to use and saved me many hours of work. 

Once you get your movie built all you have to do it manipulate an XML file to add/change the slides shows. It has lots of different transitions and effects. I'm starting to like Flash more and more...
