> Seriously, I couldn't make up a wacky numbering system like that. :) Are any of my dozen readers going to the [Colorado Blogger Bash II.V](http://www.worldwiderant.com/archives/001595.html) at Wynkoop Brewery (LoDo) this coming Saturday? [Lisa](http://www.glimpseofagrrl.com/) and I are thinking of going, and I'm hoping to meet up with some of the more technical people in the area. ([Greg](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog)? [Gordon](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046/)? [Peter](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/)? others I don't know about?)

I'd love to go. I'd really like to meet up with some of the tech bloggers that I read regularly. But I can't make this event. My family (me, wife, dog, 18 month old) is going camping with my brother-in-law's family (mommy, daddy, 5 year old, 3 year old) up near Rocky Mountain National Park.

Perhaps an alternative Colorado Tech Blogger meeting on another day? I can suggest a few cool places if anyone else is interested.
