On February 26th, an attack will begin on the phones, faxes and inboxes of every senate office in Washington DC. This is a [DDoS](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci557336,00.html) attack in meatspace. I love it. Organized by [MoveOn.org](http://www.moveon.org/), the [Virual March on Washington Headquarters](http://www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/) need volunteers.
