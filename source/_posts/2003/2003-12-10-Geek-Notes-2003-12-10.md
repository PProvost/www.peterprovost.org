I spent another day in Matt Fangman's BizTalk class today. Apparently a reader or two are either on the BizTalk team or know someone on the BizTalk team, because during the session Matt looked over at me and said, "Dude! A guy on the product team just sent me a link to your blog posting!" 

Matt's session was excellent. BTS2K4 is a significant release and has really got me thinking about SOAs. It seems like you could use a cluster of BizTalk to make adding a web service layer to an existing system a breeze. I'm not 100% sure yet, but it certainly seems like a possibility. Anyone care to comment? 

  * [SmoothWall 2.0](http://smoothwall.org/get/) - This Linux firewall distribution has just released version 2.0. The screenshots look very nice. I recently went from a Linux-based firewall to a SonicWall but maybe I should go back. [via [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/08/2157248)]
  * [Object Spaces Mapper](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=4de72cd5-4018-4362-a6af-f8887f90eb92) - If you saw the Object Spaces demo at PDC, you saw this tool. Also up recently is the [code](http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/0/7/80757b51-8ce2-442f-b6a1-cce143128e7f/DAT410.msi) and [slides](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/E/6/EE6154A8-6082-43CB-83E9-8389DDCA141A/DAT410.ppt) from that presentation.

  * [WS-I Implementation Demo](http://www.ws-i.org/implementation.aspx) - A number of vendors and platforms are represented here. If you though WS-I was just specifications, you were wrong. Just for fun, compare the sizes of the .NET implementations with the Java ones. [via [Christian Weyer's Weblog](http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/posts/42461.aspx)]
  * [Shadowfax Pre-Alpha Release](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/viewUploads.aspx?id=9c29a963-594e-4e7a-9c45-576198df8058) - Shadowfax, the SOA reference architecture from the PAG team, has just released M0.1 Pre-Alpha code for review. Interesting timing given my thoughts above...
