When I send an email from Outlook 2003 beta 2, it gets discarded. I'm not embedding any images in the email and after taking a look at the code, I'm wondering if Clemens never tested a "plain" HTML email message.

It appears that if the message comes as "text/html" it will get discarded. Am I right? Does anyone else have any ideas why this isn't working?
