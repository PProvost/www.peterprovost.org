Sounds interesting. I wonder if this could help with those scenarios where you are trying to develop an AD-aware solution, but you can't get the neccesary rights on your corporate AD...

ADAM runs as a non-operating-system service, and, as such, it does not require deployment on a domain controller. Running as a non-operating-system service means that multiple instances of ADAM can run concurrently on a single server, and each instance can be configured independently.

Sounds promising...
