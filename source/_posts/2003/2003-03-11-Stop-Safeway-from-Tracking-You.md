[AaronX](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/default.htm) sent me this... [The Man Who Would Buy Everything, Everywhere](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/10/business/10SHOP.html)&nbsp_place_holder;introduces [Rob Cockerham](http://www.cockeyed.com/). Rob didn't like that Safeway tracked his purchases with their "club card" so he made and army of cloned cards and gave them out from his website. 180 different people racked up thousands of dollars at Safeways all over the country. An interesting plan.
