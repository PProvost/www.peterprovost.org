When I was a kid I poured through the [Riverworld books by Philip Jose Farmer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345419677/peterprovosto-20). They were top-notch escapist scifi/fantasy.

This Sunday, [the SciFi channel](http://www.scifi.com/) is showing [the movie](http://www.scifi.com/onair/scifipictures/riverworld/). Apparently it is based on the first two books, which were the best ones (as far as I can remember).
