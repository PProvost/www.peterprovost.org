During the Web Services Orchestration BOF, I downloaded the Microsoft PDC Community Environment tool from [http://pdcvibe/download/PDC2003.EXE](http://pdcvibe/download/PDC2003.EXE)├é (the link only works if you are here connected to CommNet).

It is cool, but I have a few problems with it:

  1. Why doesn't it remember my passport? I click the remember me button, but it just keeps asking
  2. How the hell do I minimize the damn thing? Sure the non-rectangular shape is cool looking and all that, but there is no system menu, no minimize button. Aargh!
  3. I can't tell if it actually remembered my profile information or not. I filled it in twice and clicked Save but everytime I go back it is blank.

It is cool, I like that it keeps all my sessions in one place, but #2 bugs the crap out of me.
