As a software engineer, I've never really liked the idea of outsourcing software development to India (or anywhere else). I've opposed it at most of the companies I've worked for and been successful most of the time. Apparently [others are starting to agree with me](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/13/business/worldbusiness/13RUPE.html?ex=1046322000&en=f5424f3898c461cd&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND).
