[This article on ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/os/story/0,2000024997,20272566,00.htm) reviews a study comparing the security features of Linux with that of Windows. Basically it appears that the number&nbsp_place_holder;of CERT advisories for Windows is declining while the number for Linux is increasing. Should be interesting to see how this works itself out over the next few years. This combined with [TMC's J2EE vs. .NET benchmark](http://www.objectwatch.com/issue_42.htm) could create some new Windows converts.
