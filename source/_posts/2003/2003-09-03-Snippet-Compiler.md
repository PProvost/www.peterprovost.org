This is a cool little tool from the maker of [NetPing](http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/netping/). [Code Snippet Compiler](http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/) runs in the system tray and will popup and compile simple little test programs for you. You can create templates for different project types and more. Very cool. [via [Scott Hanselman's Weblog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/)]
