[Bill Burris](http://www.componentsnotebook.com/default.aspx) has started a page on his site called [The Agile Hacker](http://www.componentsnotebook.com/agilehacker/default.aspx). His goal is to bring agile development techniques to solo development. As a guy who has had to wear a solo agile hat many times in the past, it looks very very interesting.
