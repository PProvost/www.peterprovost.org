Yesterday Keith Brown gave me a call to discuss how the VPC development technique is working out. And as I told him, it is working out pretty well. 

Along the way, I mentioned to him that I would really like to have an RSS feed of his [new book](http://www.develop.com/kbrown/book/). He didn't know much about RSS but I convinced him that it was a no brainer. 

Well, what do you know... this morning he has [a feed for the book](http://www.develop.com/kbrown/book/rss.xml). Now it is easy for me to keep up with his new chapters! 

Thanks Keith!
