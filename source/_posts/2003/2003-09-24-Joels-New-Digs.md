[Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) just finished the new offices for his company, [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/). Very fancy. [Check it out](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html).

Highlights:

  * Everyone gets an office.
  * 20 power outlets per office
  * HDTV in the break room
  * Glowing acrylic walls
  * Support for pair programming
  * Expensive ($700 per month per developer!)
