I'm curious if anyone else out there in blogspace is noticing this. My company, a small custom software development firm in Denver, has been hearing people say things like, "Well maybe after this war-thing is resolved we'll do the project."

Aargh! [WTF](http://www.valinor.sorcery.net/glossary/WTF.html) is [GWB](http://www.bushorchimp.com/) thinking? Has he forgotten that the reason his father lost to [Clinton](http://www.zpub.com/un/un-bc.html) was that he forgot about the economy? Just because the press has [convinced most of America](http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr030228.asp) that the war is a good idea, doesn't mean that all this chatting about it is helping anyone. Either do it or don't. Quit scaring people. (For the most part I don't give a crap about politics, but now that he is affecting my livelyhood, it is starting to piss me off.)
