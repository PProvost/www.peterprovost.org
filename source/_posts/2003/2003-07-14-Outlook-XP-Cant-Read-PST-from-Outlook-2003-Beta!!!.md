This sucks. I bailed on Outlook 2003 for a variety of reasons (mostly because it was crashing on my wife and she uses this computer more than I do now).

So I dumped my stuff out to PST, uninstalled, installed Office XP, and couldn't open the PST file! What the hell?

Anyone have any suggestions for me? This sucks.
