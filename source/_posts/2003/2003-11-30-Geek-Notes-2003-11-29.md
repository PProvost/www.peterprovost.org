After spending most of yesterday and some of this morning updating my weblog theme, I didn't get around to posting a Geek Notes. Sorry. 

  * [Label Tells Fruit Ripeness](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994423) - Apparently too many people are squeezing pears, so the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand has created labels that detect the compounds emitted by the fruit. Cool. 
  * [DNA Sequencing for Kids](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/bown/2003/article/0,18881,537113,00.html) - Features a centrifuge and an [electrophoresis](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=electrophoresis&r=67) chamber. Cooler. 
  * [Scout Walker Kama Sutra](http://www.scoutwalker.com/) - Ever wondered how two Star Wars Scout Walkers would Get It On? Here's the answer. 

Not much stuff for skipping two days, eh? Oh well. I'm sure Monday will be plenty contentful. :)
