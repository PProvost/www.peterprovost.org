I love Neal's books. I've read most of them more than once.

This fall the first book in the Baroque Cycle series will be called [Quicksilver](http://www.baroquecycle.com/preview.htm). In it, he brings back members of the Waterhouse and Shaftoe families (from Cryptonomicon), but the setting is during the days of Issac Netwton and Gottfried Leibniz.

I can't wait.

UPDATE: I've got it. It's great!
