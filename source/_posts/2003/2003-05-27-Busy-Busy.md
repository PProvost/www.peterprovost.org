I haven't been posting much lately... sorry. Had a very busy holiday weekend and have a project deadline tomorrow (Wed).

I should have some good stuff coming later this week though. The project I'm finishing used a fair amount of code generation using [CodeSmith](http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/) and I'll be talking about some of the things we learned.
