  * [SharpReader Scores High](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/01/aggregators) - At least on Mark Pilgrim's blog. NewsGator (my current choice) was fourth.
  * [CSS Crib Sheet](http://www.mezzoblue.com/css/cribsheet/) - Am sure you heard me complain about CSS over the weeked. I guess I should have read this first. (And talked to [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/) too.)
