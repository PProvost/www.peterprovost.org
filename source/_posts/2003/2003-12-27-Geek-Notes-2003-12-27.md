I'm pretty much spending today doing nothing... trying to catch up from too much family time this holiday. I love them all, but sometimes you just need some time alone with your computer. <grin/>

  * [Code Smith 2.5 RC Available](http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/getfile.aspx?id=11) - This is my favorite free code generator and [Eric](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericjsmith/) has been working hard to add new features and improve the IDE integration.
  * [Fun with ILDASM](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/archives/000347.html) - Some very interesting IL gets generated when you create your own System.Object class. Try it yourself.
  * [Using SmartAssembly for Smart Clients](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/SmartAssembly.asp) - Sick of fighting the App Updater Application Block? Don't feel like rolling your own? Here is another solution for you.
  * [Dropload](http://dropload.com/) - Need to send someone a big file but their Hotmail account wont take it? Don't have your own FTP server? Use Dropload. You can upload a file up to 50MB in size and they will hold it for 48 hours. Very cool. Too bad the size it so small, I need to send a 6GB VPC image... :) [via [Sirsha](http://hdconsultants.us/posts/347.aspx)]
