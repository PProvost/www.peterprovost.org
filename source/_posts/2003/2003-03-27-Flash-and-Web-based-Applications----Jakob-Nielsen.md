I always read [Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/). I don't always agree with him, but it is always an interesting read. In [this article](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20021125.html), he summarizes a study done by [his company](http://www.nngroup.com/) where they studied 46 Flash applications for usabililty issues. They discovered that while Flash provides the tools for creating modern rich applications, most sites using it aren't using it well. Here is one I agree with.
