From [Harry Pierson's DevHawk Weblog](http://www.devhawk.net/default.aspx)

> I was looking up something on the [VS.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio) site when I noticed a link to [PowerToys for VS.NET 2003](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/ide). There are currently 5 PowerToys available:
> 
>   * [VSTweak](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/vstweak.exe) - Allows you to modify some of the more obscure VS.NET options and settings 
>   * [VSEdit](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/vsedit.exe) - Command line tool to load a file into currently running instance of VS.NET 
>   * [VSWindowManager](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/VSWindowManager.exe) - Enables you to design your own custom window layouts 
>   * [Custom Help Builder](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/CustomHelpBuilder.exe) - allows you to create a custom help collection for your XML-style commented Visual Basic or Visual C# class library. Integrates the custom help collection into the VS.NET help system 
>   * [VB Commenter](http://apps.gotdotnet.com/ide/powertoys/VBCommenter.exe) - XML-style comment tags for VB 
> 
> Future tools include:
> 
>   * VSCMDShell Window - One window to access both the VS.NET Commands Window and your external CMD.exe process. 
>   * VSMouseBindings - Assign all five mouse buttons to commands within VS.NET 
>   * VSTransparency - Make floating windows and pop-up UI semi-transparent in the IDE giving you a better view of the code below 
> 
> Sweet!
