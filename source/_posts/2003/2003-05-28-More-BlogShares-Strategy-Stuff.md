I thought I'd post a follow-to to my [description of my BlogShares strategy](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/05/23.html#a363). I have made a few changes:

  * Upgrade your account to Premium. It is only $15 and you can then make unlimited trades
  * Buy using the same search I used before
  * Sell anything with P/E over 4

Since my last post about this (5/23) my account balance has gone from ~$150,000 to more than $375,000 (5/28). That is more than 2x in five days.
