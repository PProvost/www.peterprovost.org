In [this article](http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/weblog/2003/02/05.html#a151), [Jason Whittington](http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/weblog/) shows an interesting and potentially useful side-effect of using nested classes. I don't often use nested public classes, but if I needed what Jason needed, this would certainly be&nbsp_place_holder;an elegant solution.
