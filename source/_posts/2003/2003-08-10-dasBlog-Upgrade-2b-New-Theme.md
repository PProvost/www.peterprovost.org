Spent a couple of hours last night and then a couple more this morning creating a new theme for dasBlog 1.1. It has some aspects that are blatant ripoffs of [Clemens'](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/) new theme (e.g. drop shadows), but it also has a few things that I think are unique. Also, his uses CSS based layout, while mine uses tables. I'm still thinking about how to get my Outlook theme in here, but that's gonna have to wait.

Many thanks to whoever created the [theme and macro documentation](http://www.dasblog.net/documentation/CategoryView.aspx?category=Templates%20and%20Macros) on the [dasBlog site](http://www.dasblog.net/documentation/). Nice work.
