You've probably heard me talk about the forthcoming UIP application block (MVC for ASP.NET and WinForms). Well, it has finally shipped, along with a few others:

  * [User Interface Process Application Block](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=f4a967a0-f36b-4ebe-8d33-f57784bdfb0f&displaylang=en)&nbsp_place_holder;- MVC and workflow for .NET
  * [Configuration Management Application Block](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=85cb1c53-8ca7-4a92-85e3-e4795bd27feb&displaylang=en) - Don't like storing connection strings where everyone can read them? This will help.
  * [Updater Application Block](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c6c17f3a-d957-4b17-9b97-296fb4927c30&displaylang=en) - Particularly useful in Smart Client application, the updater provides a "pull model" to automatically download application updates from the Internet.

Also, Harry Pierson is keeping a list of all of the Application Blocks and other P&P articles in the [navigation pane of his weblog](http://www.devhawk.net/). Enjoy!
