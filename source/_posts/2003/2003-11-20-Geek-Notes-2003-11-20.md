So far, I'm very happy with NewsGator. Posting works well, reading in Outlook is good. There are a few weirdnesses, but I'm learning to deal with them. 

Here's what I found today. 

  * [The Lowdown on Help in VS.Whidbey](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/timsull/commentview.aspx/bd075a79-1033-4cd2-9611-815e90ee274c) - Tim Sullivan tells us what to expect. One thing that I've been looking for for a while is the option of going online for F1 MSDN help. It may suck, but I sure hope it doesn't. 
  * [Why Requirements, Analysis, and Design No Longer Make Sense](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/phasesExamined.htm) - A new essay by Scott Ambler that questions whether we still need to be performing these traditional development tasks. 
  * [Ink Log](http://www.inklog.com/) - Apparently blogging with a Tablet PC is cool, but without text-recognition and an RSS feed, why would I care? 
  * [Designing Quality Frameworks](http://weblogs.asp.net/jezell/posts/38755.aspx) - Jesse Ezell posts some excellent advice for people designing frameworks. Key points: Keep it simple, take your time, assume ignorance, test aggressively, be consistent. 
  * [Stopping Blog Spam Redux](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/11/20-144.html) - Luke Hutteman posts another idea for stopping blog spam. An interesting idea... let them do it, but steal their links.
