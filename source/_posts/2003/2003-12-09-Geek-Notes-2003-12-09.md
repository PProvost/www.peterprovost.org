  * [Data Storage Design, Backup, and Restore for Windows SharePoint Services](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/sharepoint/wssipo2D.asp) - A new whitepaper on TechNet about deploying and configuring WSS Environments. [via [Tim Heuer's Weblog](http://timheuer.com/blog/posts/297.aspx)]
  * [Python Runs Fast on .NET](http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2003/Dec-09.html) - Sounds like Iron Python, a new implementation for .NET is screaming! Faster than CPython-2.3.
  * [WTL 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1be1eb52-aa96-4685-99a5-4256737781c5&displaylang=en) - This new release provides full support for VS.NET 2003 and _adds_ support for Windows CE.
  * [Lean Software Development Review](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/darrell.norton/posts/4306.aspx) - I'm not sure if this is a review of the book or just an overview, but it is a good read. There are a number of excellent links at the end of the article.
