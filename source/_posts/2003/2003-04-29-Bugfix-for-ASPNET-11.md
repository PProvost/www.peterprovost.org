I think I talked about this a while ago... not sure.

[Paul Wilson ](http://www.wilsondotnet.com/)first noticed this bug, which becomes very obvious if you use a page template technique that inserts a form tag inside of a user control. Well, it looks like MS has released a patch for it, so if you run across this problem, read [this article](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?id=818803).
