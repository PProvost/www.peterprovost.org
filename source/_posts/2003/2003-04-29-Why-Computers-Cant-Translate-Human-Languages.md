This has to be an excellent example of why computer-based human-language translation doesn't work. I don't even understand what the product does... except that it will "guarantee...a pleasant change of atmosphere". What? Sounds almost as silly as [Relax and Breathe](http://www.relaxandbreathe.com/queon/flash/).
