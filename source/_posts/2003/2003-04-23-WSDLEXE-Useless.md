Apparently [a lot of people think so](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx#nn2003-04-22T05:52:21Z)...

It may be less than ideal, but the way I used it was to create the .cs file. Add it to my project, derive my ASMX code-behind file from the new class and (the bad part) re-add the [WebMethod] attributes. Sure, it would be better if I didn't have to redo the attributes, but that is about all I had to do...

If Don finds any better tools that let us skip these extra steps, it would be nice, but honestly it wasn't that much work.
