If any of my 9 readers are at the PDC and would like to find me, you can reach me on MSN IM using "peter at provost dot org". Feel free to pop me a message and we can meet somewhere. With 7000 people here it will be hard enough to find people you know... even if you don't really know them.

If you see me walking the halls, grab me and chat. Here is a pic:
