Wow. I didn't think people were still getting [funding like this](http://www.counterpane.com/pr-seriesd.html). I have to say it makes me happy though. I think Bruce Schneier is one of the smartest security guys around. If you don't already subscribe to his newsletter, [CRYPTO-GRAM](http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html), then you should.
