Nikhil Kothari has posted some [sample code](http://www.nikhilk.net/Content/Samples/HtmlComponent.zip) that is apparently based on an early Web Matrix prototype. Does anyone on the BlogX team want to take a look at using this instead of the old COM editor? (I'm assuming BlogX still uses that... I could be wrong. I haven't actually switched over yet.)
