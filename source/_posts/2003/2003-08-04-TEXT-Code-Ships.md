[Scott Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/) has finally posted the code for his N-Tiered .TEXT blog engine to a [workspace on GDN](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=e99fccb3-1a8c-42b5-90ee-348f6b77c407).

Wow!

Two excellent open source blog engines in less than a month (the other is [dasBlog](http://www.dasBlog.net/)&nbsp_place_holder;of course).

Nice work guys.
