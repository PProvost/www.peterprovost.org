I just got out of this session and am writing this from the bus on the way back to my hotel. From there we are off to Universal Studios for the attendee party. They've rented out the entire place for just us! Kick ass.

If you've read my blog for long, you've probably heard me rave about code generation tools like CodeSmith and LLBLGen. I've written a number of Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tes in CodeSmith and I've demoed LLBLGenPro. Both techniques work well, but I've always wanted something built into the framework. The ones I wrote were specifically for my needs and didn't support things like relationships, lazy loading of child relationships, etc. LLBLGen supports some of that, maybe all, but it is still essentially a code generator.

I've been hearing about ObjectSpaces for a while now but it has been very hard to get any information about it. And with all the hype about the other Whidbey and Longhorn technologies, it seemed to be ignored by the community. 

ObjectSpaces is three things:

1. System.Data.ObjectSpaces is the namespace containing the core ORM subsystems in Whidbey  
2. Microsoft.Data.ObjectSpaces (or something like that) contains utilites for generating databases from object graphs and vice versa  
3. VS.NET (Whidbey) will have a very cool editor for mapping table and columns to objects and fields. 

This stuff appears to be exactly wat I was hoping for. I tried my best to copy the code from the demos below, and for this kind of this the code is the best way to see what is going on. I cannot guarantee that this code is correct, and it certainly will not compile, as I was typing it in on the fly as the presenter switched between slides and code. But it is close enough to give you an idea of what I was seeing. Unfortunately I didn't catch all of the code for ObjectSpaces -> ADO.NET interop (case 5), but I'm sure that will be pretty straightforward. This is the Good Stuff.

Look in the switch statement to see how database initialization, reading and then updating work. This stuff is VERY cool and is going to save us business app developers TONS of time and code.

Enjoy!
