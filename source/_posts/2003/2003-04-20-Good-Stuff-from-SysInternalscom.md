[Fabrice noticed](http://dotnetweblogs.com/FMARGUERIE/posts/5769.aspx) [my post ](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/04/16.html#a237)about using [Handle ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/handle.shtml)to figure out who had a file locked. As he noted, [SysInternals ](http://www.sysinternals.com/)is an excellent site with tons of very cool tools. They have even more good stuff in the [Utilities](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/utilities.shtml) section that I use fairly often:

  * [DebugView ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml)- lets you get a debug log on a machine without a debugger installed. 
  * [PortMon ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/portmon.shtml)- basically creates a log of a serial port. I used it to fine-tune the protocol used by Garmin GPS units. 
  * [RegMon ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/regmon.shtml)- monitors all registry access in real-time. 
  * [PageDefrag ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pagedefrag.shtml)- defrags page file and registry hives. I put it on every machine I build. 
  * [BgInfo ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/bginfo.shtml)- useful on remote servers and if you use a KVM on multiple machines. Creates a desktop image after each login that shows useful info about the machine. For example: Name, Domain, Network Settings, etc. 
  * [NewSID ](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/newsid.shtml)- resets the SID on a Ghosted machine

There are lots more excellent tools there, but these are the ones I've used.
