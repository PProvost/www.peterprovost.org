I don't know who I agree with here, but it just goes to show that politics and music shouldn't mix. That is part of the reason [I don't like U2 very much](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/03/23.html#a159). Pearl Jam has the same problem, as [Eddie Vedder found out in Denver Tuesday](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=501&e=2&u=/ap/war_concert_walkout). [from "AaronX"]
