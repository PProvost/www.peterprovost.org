I went over to the Win2K3 launch this morning and one of the things they showed was that the file system maintains older versions of files. In the demo, he opened a file in PowerPoint, made change and then saved it. Then he went to the file, chose Properties and went to the Versions tab to restore the original version.

I'm running Win2K3 on my machine right now and I'm not seeing a version tab. What was he doing that he didn't tell us? Was he really using the Shadow Copy feature?
