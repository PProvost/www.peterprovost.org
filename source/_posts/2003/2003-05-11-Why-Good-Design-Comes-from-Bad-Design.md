I found this article on Roy's ISerializable weblog. An excellent read that got me thinking about a few things in my life. The most important one is something that I teach to all just-starting-out developers: the best way to solve a problem is to explain it to someone else. This is very similar to what Scott is saying in his article. The other thing I do is repeat something my dad used to say, "No it isn't a better idea, it is another idea."

I really like the quotes Scott collected at the conclusion of his article. I like them so much, I'll repeat them here:

> _"The two most important tools an architect has are the eraser in the drawing room and the sledge hammer on the construction site." ?Frank Lloyd Wright_
> 
> _Hemingway rewrote the ending to A Farewell to Arms 39 times. When asked about how he achieved his great works, he said, "I write 99 pages of crap for every one page of masterpiece." He has also been quoted as saying "the first draft of anything is shit."_
> 
> _"The physicist's greatest tool is his wastebasket." ?Albert Einstein_
> 
> _"Rewrite and revise. Do not be afraid to seize what you have and cut it to ribbons ? Good writing means good revising." ?Strunk and White, Elements of Style_
> 
> **
