Ahhhh... another day with just my wife and daughter. No obligations, nothing to do. Just recuperate from the hectic holiday schedule. 

  * [Embedding .NET Controls in Java](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/javanet.asp) - Wow. This is pretty cool. I can't believe anyone even tried it.
  * [Computerized Gravestone](http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2003/12/talk_about_geek.html) - This is insane. Or is it? I had the idea of putting a flexible LCD on the back of a urinal and everyone laughed at me. Maybe the time is right...

  * Japander - American stars go to Japan to make a quick buck hawking products they would never touch here. Don't believe me? Check this out. [via [Carnage4Life](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=32d0b2f5-8453-4aef-80f6-8641af28fbcb)]

And... I just realized I have to go back to work tomorrow. Bummer.
