[My CVS experiment](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/06/14.html#a415) is proceeding well. So far I'm extremely impressed with [TortoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/) as a client. I'm blown away by the speed. It handled things like renamed files well. All-in-all, I'm happy. Web projects are a little weird, but thanks to [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/), I think I've got a solution that works well.

Soon I will write this up properly and help all you VSS users make the move.
