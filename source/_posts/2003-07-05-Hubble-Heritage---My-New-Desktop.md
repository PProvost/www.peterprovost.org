I love the [Hubble Heritage Project](http://heritage.stsci.edu/) website. I get more cool desktop images from there that anywhere else. Except maybe for digital pics of my daughter. [Here is the new one](http://heritage.stsci.edu/current/00/index.html) that I just made my desktop:

> Denoted N 49, or DEM L 190, this remnant is from a massive star that died in a supernova blast whose light would have reached Earth thousands of years ago. This filamentary material will eventually be recycled into building new generations of stars in the LMC. Our own Sun and planets are constructed from similar debris of supernovae that exploded in the Milky Way billions of years ago.
