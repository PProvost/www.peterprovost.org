It is so weird how things like this happen...

Last night I was doing my monthly "clean up my hard drive" ritual and when I was done, I noticed something... now my machine shuts down fatser. Specifically, the time between choosing Start | Shutdown and seeing the dialog has been cut down from almost 10 seconds to almost immediate. Apparently having a very full Recycle Bin causes that behavior. Who knows why.

Now the weird part is this... I figured that out last night. Then this morning I came and found [this posting](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog/2003/03/17.html#a66)&nbsp_place_holder;in my news aggregator. Weird.
