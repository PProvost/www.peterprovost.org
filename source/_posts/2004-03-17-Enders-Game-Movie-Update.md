For those of you who love Orson Scott Card's book Ender's Game, you'll be happy to hear that the plans for the movie have made an important jump forward: 

> Variety Magazine announced on 10 February that Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, the writing team that created the _X-Men 2_ screenplay, have been hired by Warner Brothers to write the second draft of the _Ender's Game_ screenplay. 
> 
> Harris and Dougherty have already been in contact with Orson Scott Card, the author of both _Ender's Game_ and _Ender's Shadow,_ both of which have been optioned by Warner Brothers as the basis for the _Ender's Game_ movie. Card wrote the first draft of the screenplay based on both books.
