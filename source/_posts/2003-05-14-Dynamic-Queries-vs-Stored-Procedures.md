In [this article](http://dotnetweblogs.com/fbouma/posts/7008.aspx), [Franz Bouma](http://dotnetweblogs.com/fbouma/) does some benchmarking to compare the performance differences between dynamic queries and stored procedures. Interesting results... dynamic queries are faster. It'll be interesting to see how people respond to this.
