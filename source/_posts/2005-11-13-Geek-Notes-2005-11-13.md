I've been very very busy getting CAB out the door and haven't been reading or writing much lately. Oh well... you gotta do what you gotta do.

I'm really looking forward to Thanksgiving this year. We (the entire family) are going back to Denver for a week from 11/22 till 11/29. I'm sure it will be hectic as all hell, but I'm also sure it will be fun.

Oh and speaking of vacation, the Seattle winter (rain) has started and Emily is already starting to talk about takinig a vacation to the sun in January. I guess that is just part of choosing to live in a place where the sun doesn't shine for 5 months.

  * [Obfuscated Monad Script](http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/11/obfuscated_mona.html) - Adam Barr is truly the king of Monad geeks with this one. It took me 30 minutes to figure out how it works, but I did eventually figure it out.

  * [ShowEzMDIFileList](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/11/04/16203.aspx) - Craig Andera discovered this little keyboard shortcut. In Visual Studio 2005 press Ctrl+Alt+Down and you will get a little popup menu in the upper right corner that contains the names of all the open windows. Turns out that keystroke is bound to the "Window.ShowEzMDIFileList" command by default. Hmmm... nice command... bad keystroke. I think I may need to put that one somewhere a bit more convenient.

  * [Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com/) - Amazon has a new umm... marketplace where you can do work for someone else online and get paid. At this point, the only "work" is helping A9 get the storefront images right for their search engine, but they will pay you $0.03 per image, which if you can do 1 every 15 seconds (a bit hard) can yield you a whopping $7.20 per hour.

  * [Exporting Templates in VS2005](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2005/11/06/134343.aspx) - This one made me laugh because I've been making my VS item templates by hand, which isn't that hard but certainly isn't as easy as choosing Export Template from the File menu.

  * [Debuging MSH Scripts Part 4: set-mshdebug](http://blogs.msdn.com/monad/archive/2005/11/09/491035.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;- Over on the Monad [Team Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/monad/default.aspx) Jon Newman has been posting a series about debugging MSH scripts and chapter 4 really caught my eye. This is an excellent help given the lack of a true debugger. Cool.
