I know I haven't been posting much latelyΓÇª sorry. Been busy busy busyΓÇª

One of the things I've been working on is the CompositeUI Application Block (CAB). CAB is basically a framework for building complicated Windows Forms applications from other simpler parts. I'll be blogging a lot more about it in the coming weeks and months, but for now I wanted to let you all know that we have just posted our second community drop on our [GDN Workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c).

So, if you are interested in seeing the kinds of things we are doing in this block, or how we are using Whidbey features, please [join the workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c) and [download it](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c).

Thanks!
