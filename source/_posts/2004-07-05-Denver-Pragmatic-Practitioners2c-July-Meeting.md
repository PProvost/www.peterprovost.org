**Topic:**  
Interviewing

Sooner or later, every developer is asked to participate in the interview process. Or, when developers become managers, they must oversee the interviews for new members of their teams.

How can you effectively interview someone with just a few hours of face to face time? Does being an agile team mean you should look for certain attributes when interviewing new members for your team?

The Denver Pragmatic Practitioners take an informal approach to meeting. We prefer conversations over pizza and beer, so come ready to make some new friends and have a great chat about interviewing! Refreshments will be provided.

We look forward to seeing you there!

UPDATE: I won't be able to make this meeting because of the new kid, but it is still happening. Please go and have fun!
