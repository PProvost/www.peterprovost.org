Not that many good April Fool's day jokes on the net yesterday but there were a few good ones on the radio. Here in Denver KBPI had people lined up all morning waiting for free gas. 

Yeah right! 

And on NPR, they had an excellent story about the [ZIP Code Portability Act of 2004](http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1805651). That was some funny shit! 

  * [iTunes iSbogus](http://www.downhillbattle.org/itunes/index.html) - This is not an April Fool's joke but and excellent rip on the iTunes music store. 
  * [SimpleScript Part One](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/31/105329.aspx) - Eric Lippert has to create a new script engine (and maybe a debugger, editor and host) for a client. He will be blogging the whole experience. Ugh. I pity him. 
  * [Fun with the IE Content Advisor](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=150909a2-c407-4ac3-a3bc-57ad60e3c482) - Scott Hanselman tells an interesting tale about how the IE Content Advisor can give your customers problems if you aren't careful. 
  * [Hall of Technical Documentation Weirdness](http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/hall/) - I'm sure you've seen some of these before, but it is Friday so have some fun! [via [Eric Gunnerson](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/04/01/105773.aspx)] 
  * [UNIX-style Mount Point in C#](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/04/01/105946.aspx) - Fun bit of console app coding from Brad Abrams. 
  * [Mono Brainshare PPT Slides](http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Mar-30.html) - A set of decks that introduce mono for developers... fun. Now that I have OSX for my wife's Mac, I'll have to try out Mono. 
  * [Linux Losing Ground in the Enterprise?](http://www.forbes.com/technology/2004/03/31/cz_dl_0331linux.html) - I don't know if it is happening on a global scale yet, but this article certainly shows that some people are getting cold feet. 

So after reading that Linux article and thinking about it some more, I have to ask a question... why is it that Red Hat charging $179 and up for RH Enterprise Linux isn't a violation of the GPL? Sure... I know... they claim that it is for "support" but if that is true, then why is the fee "per-installed-processor"? And if I don't want the support, why do I have to pay? 

Seems to me that the Linux folks are so busy being anti-Microsoft that they aren't paying attention to their own backyard.
