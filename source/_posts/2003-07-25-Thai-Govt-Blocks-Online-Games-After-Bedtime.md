[This article](http://rss.com.com/2100-1043_3-5053209.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) on CNET reports that the Thai government, prompted by concerned parents, has instituted a block on online games after bed time. Apparently too many kids were staying up late playing Ragnarok Online. This is rediculous. How long until there are redirection servers outside of Korea? I've said this hundreds of times before... **You can't beat the kids**.
