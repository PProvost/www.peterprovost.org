I have two things that are bugging the crap out of me about Radio. The first problem is that the comments engine is still acting hokey. Sometimes my public page loads extremely slowly and the javascript comment engine times out. The second problem is that the Radio macro I use to display mySubscriptions doesn't like the OPML feel provided by SharpReader. Bummer.
