OK, so I'm a little late to the party, but I'm watching Star Wars 2: Attack of the Clones on TiVo right now. Didn't see it in the theatres. Boy am I glad I didn't spend any money on this.

I know that the original three were full of cheezy dialog, but this is just├é terrible. The interaction between Annakin and Amidala is terrible. 

> Annakin Skywalker: "You love me? I thought that we had decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. And it would destroy our lives."
> 
> Senator Amidala: "I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I do truly, deeply, love you. But before we die, I want you to know."

It brings back terrible memories of├é Princess Leia saying "I love you," and Han Solo responding with "I know."

And then there is Annakin's constant emotional whining. Once again, I shouldn't be surprised. Remember Luke in the first movie? All that "I've got to get our of here and join the rebellion" whining? Oh yeah, same old crap.

It was great when I was 10 years old, but it just doesn't cut it anymore. I can't wait for Episode 3. (On my TiVo for FREE!)
