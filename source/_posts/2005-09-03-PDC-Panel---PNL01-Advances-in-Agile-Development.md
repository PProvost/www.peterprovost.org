The pressure for application development teams to deliver more value to the business has never been greater. No single methodology fits all project types, yet it's critical to provide a common framework and taxonomy across projects and teams. Come see how industry gurus and leading services organizations discuss advances in using a combination of agile frameworks and methodologies, like 'MSF for Agile Software Development' to deliver real business value by helping development teams meet aggressive delivery schedules and achieve better, faster, and cheaper results, while at the same time adapting to changing business requirements.
