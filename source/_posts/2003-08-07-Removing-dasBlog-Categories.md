Before I start digging through the code, I'm wondering if someone could give me the long and the short of what I would have to do to remove a category from dasBlog.

I didn't use categories in Radio, but I've started using them since moving to dasBlog and now I want to consolidate some of them. If I open all of the entries from a particular category and change it, will the category go away? Do I need to remove it from some other XML file?

TIA
