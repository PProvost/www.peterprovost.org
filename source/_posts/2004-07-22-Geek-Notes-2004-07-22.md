I am busy as hell with work and family...

But here's a few good nuggets I've found over&nbsp_place_holder;the past couple of days.

  * [Picasa](http://picasa.com/google/) - Google bought this image management tool and is now giving it away [via [Scott Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2004/07/16/12638.aspx)] 
  * [BizTalk Pipeline Component Wizard](http://martijnh.blogspot.com/2004/07/pipeline-component-wizard.html) - We had Scott Woodgate's [BTS04 Adapter Wizard](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottwoo/archive/2004/07/08/177770.aspx), and now we have a wizard for pipelines. Nice. I need all of this sutff, so keep it coming! 
  * [Outsourcing Fast Food](http://www.iht.com/articles/529970.html) - Apparently when you order from the little speaker box there is no guarantee that the person you're talking to is even in the same state as you. [via [TechDirt](http://techdirt.com/articles/20040719/0033252.shtml)] 
  * [BizTalk Joy](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottwoo/archive/2004/07/19/187563.aspx) - Scott Woodgate is pouring out the information... promoting properties, BizTalk documenter, SOA whitepapers, etc. 
  * [Microsoft Buys Lindows](http://techdirt.com/articles/20040719/1049244.shtml) - Well... not the company but the name. Now they needn't be quite so worried about trademark infringement of the Windows name. 
  * [Lots of MSBuild Tasks](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2004/07/20/187950.aspx) - I think I blogged this a long time ago, but Jamie Cansdale re-found the comprehensive list of MSBuild tasks produced by Microsoft UK.
