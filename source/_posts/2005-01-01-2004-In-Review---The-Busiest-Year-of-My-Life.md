I was looking back over my posts for 2004 and realized how ridiculously busy we were this last year...

In January, I spent most of my professional time writing an Outlook Add-in with COM in C++ and [hating it](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/01/08/1031.aspx). The [family got sick a lot](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/01/11/1032.aspx), but that's what having kids is all about. Also, in January my&nbsp_place_holder;six month tenure as a [Microsoft MVP](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/) began (it ended when I became a MS employee in August.

In February, I experienced [morons in movie theatres](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/02/02/1053.aspx), [visited the MTC in Silicon Valley](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/02/08/1061.aspx), [got Interlink into blogging](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/02/17/1071.aspx), [watched too much American Idol](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/02/17/1069.aspx), and wrote my [HOWTO: Adopt .NET For Free](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/02/18/1072.aspx) post.

In March, Emily and I had [the worst flying experience of our lives](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/03/14/1101.aspx), [presented Threats and Threat Modeling at DevDays](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/03/19/1109.aspx), wrote about [Blogroll Cosmology](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/03/22/1119.aspx), and [proposed a BoF Session for TechEd](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/03/31/1138.aspx).

In April, I went to the MVP Summit (see [Day 0](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/04/04/1145.aspx), [Timing Is Interesting](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/04/07/1150.aspx) and the [Wrap-up post](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/04/09/1153.aspx)). While there I met up with [Scott Densmore](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore) and [Jim Newkirk](http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/), who I now work with. In fact, that was when I was encouraged to apply for the job I now have. Many thanks to Jim and Scott for that. Also in April, I wrote the [dasBlog2DotText converter program](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/04/12/1157.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;and [gave a lecture at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/04/26/1167.aspx) with [David Yack](http://weblogs.asp.net/mrdave).

May was a busy blogging month with 57 posts. Whew. I opened the month by [making the switch to .TEXT](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/01/1177.aspx). I was [asked to work Harry Pierson's cabana at TechEd](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/01/1179.aspx), [replaced a wiper motor on my car](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/02/1186.aspx), saw [the Avs get eliminated from the playoffs](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/05/1193.aspx), [introduced blog ratings](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/05/1199.aspx), and&nbsp_place_holder;[had my backyard landscaped](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/08/1219.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;(with [lots](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/15/1252.aspx) of [pictures](http://www.peterprovost.org/gallery/25.aspx)).

Also in May I started work on my basement by [smashing out a dummy brick fireplace](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/16/1255.aspx), wrote my [Software Development Karate Belts](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/19/1265.aspx) post, and made a number of posts about and from TechEd ([1](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/21/1278.aspx), [2](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/22/1282.aspx), [3](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/23/1284.aspx), [4](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/23/1286.aspx), [5](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/23/1288.aspx), [6](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/23/1289.aspx), [7](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/24/1290.aspx), [8](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/24/1292.aspx), [9](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/24/1293.aspx), [10](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/24/1295.aspx), [11](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/25/1298.aspx), [12](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/25/1299.aspx), [13](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/27/1302.aspx), [14](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/27/1303.aspx)). I also wrote [a post about VSTS and religion](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/05/27/1303.aspx) that hinted at a more controversial post I would be making in June.

In June [Kris Syverstad](http://weblogs.ilg.com/ksyverstad/archive/2004/06/01/367.aspx#FeedBack) and [I blogged](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/02/1318.aspx) a bit about the analogies between developers and professional athletes. I [discovered the PAG bloggers](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/02/1332.aspx), [found a free uptme service](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/11/1374.aspx), and [switched to BlogJet](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/30/1569.aspx) for posting. In the middle of the month, I gave a fun series of talks called [Building Quality .NET Solutions](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/18/1515.aspx) that focused on the things you don't often hear about: Unit testing, build systems, continuous integration, etc.

Also June was the month where I wrote the now infamous [Unit Testing in Visual Studio 2005](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/12/1379.aspx) post (which has 169 comments&nbsp_place_holder;on it at this point) and a [couple](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/13/1410.aspx) of [follow-ups](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/14/1472.aspx). The interesting thing about this post is that it was made during the time between my interviews for the job with PAG and receiving notification about getting the job. Some might say that I shouldn't have made a post like that while trying to get a job at Microsoft, but honestly, if they weren't going to hire me for saying something like that, then I probably didn't want to work there. I'm a loud-mouth and I say what's on my mind, so deal with it.

As it so often does, it all worked itself out, eh?

In July we [took Hadley to her first movie](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/07/01/1576.aspx) (Shrek 2), [Craig Andera](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/default.aspx) and I [posted dasBlog2DotText to Sourceforge](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/07/04/1587.aspx), and [Enterprise Library was announced](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/07/30/1681.aspx). Not much else happened in July...

...umm...

No... wait...

Oh yeah! My son [Finn Mansfield was born on July 8th](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/07/09/1603.aspx). ![](file:///C:/Program%20Files/BlogJet/Data/Smiles/smile2.gif)&nbsp_place_holder;I was posting pics over dial up from the hospital to the the [Finn Image Gallery](http://www.peterprovost.org/gallery/29.aspx). He is a wonderful, beautiful child and we love him more than life itself.

In August I announced my move to Microsoft to the world with the post [Peter Takes the Red Pill](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/04/1701.aspx). I [continued](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/04/1695.aspx) [to](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/01/1686.aspx) [work](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/07/1737.aspx) on [finishing](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/15/1771.aspx) [the](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/16/1785.aspx) [basement](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/19/1808.aspx) of our Victorian-era bungalow. I also [moved my sites off of the server](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/15/1771.aspx) in my basement and onto a server at [WebHost4Life](http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=PProvost). Somewhere in there, I actually got some client work done and as part of that created a [Generic BizTalk Build System with NAnt](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/18/1802.aspx). The month ended with us [moving to Seattle](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/27/1823.aspx) and [me starting work](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/08/31/1829.aspx).

In September I [surprised Emily](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/09/11/1870.aspx) by flying her best friend in for a surprise visit. Other than that, I was mostly focused on us [getting settled in Seattle](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/09/20/1898.aspx), [selling our Denver house](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/09/30/1917.aspx), and [getting settled into my new job](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/09/17/1894.aspx). And something I didn't blog about: shortly after getting to Washington, my wife Emily found out that she has some kind of auto-immune disorder, possibly [lupus](http://www.lupus.org/) or [antiphospholipid antibody&nbsp_place_holder;syndrome](http://www.hss.edu/Conditions/Antiphospholipid-Syndrome/Antiphospholipid-Antibody-Syndrome). It seems to be under control at this point, but the timing certainly could have been better.

October was fun. I had a poetry contest to see who would get my [GMail invites](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/04/1931.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;and [posted the winners](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/06/1942.aspx), wrote a cool little reg-[hack for running NUnitConsole on any DLL or EXE](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/13/1984.aspx), [used a metal detector to find a missing engagement ring](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/21/2000.aspx), and [went to Win-Dev Boston](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/27/2019.aspx) to give two talks. Somewhere in there I also figured out [how to make IE display the application/xhtml+xml mime type properly](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/10/22/2003.aspx). 

In November I made a [couple](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/01/2040.aspx) of [posts](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/04/2067.aspx) about developing as a non-administrator. [Brian Button](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/oneagilecoder/) and I figured out a [cool way to unit test the interaction between two threads](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/03/2052.aspx). [Atticus came from Denver](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/08/2080.aspx), Emily and I [celebrated out 4th anniversary](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/11/2096.aspx), started [learning to touch-type](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/12/2104.aspx), [Jamie Cansdale](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/) [shipped TestDriven.NET 1.0](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/29/2210.aspx), and we learned that it [really is rainy and cold in Seattle](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/29/2212.aspx) in the winter. Somewhere in there, Brian Button and I [went to a great talk at MSR by Ward Cunningham](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/21/2394.aspx).

At the start of December, [Emily and Finn went to Denver](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/03/2232.aspx) leaving me and Hadley to fend for ourselves. I babbled a bit about [RAII and IDisposable in .NET](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/05/2246.aspx), settles on a new [RSS aggregator](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/07/2281.aspx), we all [got sick again](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/10/2313.aspx), I finally had to [deal with](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/12/2365.aspx) [comments spam](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/12/2345.aspx), posted [another non-admin trick](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/19/2386.aspx), and we had [our first Christmas in Washington](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/12/27/2404.aspx).

Wow, what a year. I think I'll try to make 2005&nbsp_place_holder;a little less hectic. No new children, no moves, no job changes. Nice and mellow.

Best wishes to all my readers in 2005. Thanks for taking time out of your valuable schedule to read my occasional ramblings.
