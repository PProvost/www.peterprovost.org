> I don't want to point to a bug list for .net. I would rather there were not any at all, but there are, and because there are, its good to know what they are. There is a privately (Dejan Jelovic) maintained bug list [here](http://www.jelovic.com/dotnetbugs/).

I agree. I wish we didn't have to have such a list, but we do. Thanks for pointing it out and thanks to Dejan for maintaining it.
