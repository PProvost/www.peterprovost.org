[Donnie Mack](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/donnymack/) reminds me of a post [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/) made a few months ago about how to enable compression in IIS6 on Windows Server 2003. Since I just moved all of my sites onto a new IIS6 machine, I suppose I should turn this stuff on too.

I wonder...

a) Why isn't it on be default?

b) Why isn't it easier to setup?

Someone should write a little utility to do this for us...
