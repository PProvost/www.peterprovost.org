Wondering what to do with that old Intellivision console in a box in your basement? Install IntyOS on it and you've got a computer!

> **IntyOS** is a **multitasked operating system** for the **Intellivision** console. It includes a **powerful GUI** which handles a mouse pointer, windows, menus, icons, etc.
