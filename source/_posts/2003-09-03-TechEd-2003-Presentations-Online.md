In case you didn't get a chance to go to TechEd this year, I just found that most (all?) of the presentations are available online. I don't mean just the PowerPoint decks, I mean the whole thing. Decks, audio, everything!

Visit [http://microsoft.sitestream.com/](http://microsoft.sitestream.com/) to see it all. Tres cool.
