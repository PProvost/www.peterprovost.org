This week I was in Berlin presenting four sessions at TechEd Europe. This is a
beautiful city and it was a great event.

We were very fortunate to be here for the 20th anniversary celebration of the
falling of the Berlin Wall and I thought I'd share some pics. Don Smith got a
bunch more using his much better camera and we also got some video of it
actually coming down, but these are all I have here with me tonight.

As you may be able to tell it was pouring down rain for the 2+ hours we waited
for it all to happen, but the people were fun, there was music and speeches (in
German) and best of all...  [Gl&uuml;hwein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glogg)!
