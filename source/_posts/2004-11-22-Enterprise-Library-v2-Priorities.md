As we approach the public release of Enterprise Library, we are starting to think about the kinds of things our customers would like to see in the next version. (Yes, I know you haven't seen v1, but you probable have read the [announcement](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/comingsoon.mspx) and hopefully the design docs on the [GDN Workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327), so you know what it is all about.)

Anyway, if you are interested in helping shape the next release of Enterprise Library, there is a new survey up that lets you help set the priorities of possible new blocks. Want an ORM block? Or a new rev of UIP? Let us know.
