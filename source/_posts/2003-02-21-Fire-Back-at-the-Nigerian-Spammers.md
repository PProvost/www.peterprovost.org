I love shit like this. A perfect use of computer technology... and automatic response generator for [Nigerian Scam](http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/scams/nigeria.htm) email messages. You know what I'm talking about... "We have 10 billion dollars that we can't get to. Please send us your bank account number and we'll give you 10% of it!"

[This thing](http://www.flooble.com/fun/reply.php)&nbsp_place_holder;generates an automatic reply full of mumbo jumbo. You just send it back and enjoy!
