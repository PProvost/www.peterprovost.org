The responses from everyone regarding my pending move have been amazing. Thanks to everyone for your support.

And to answer a question that was posted in the comments... yes I will keep blogging. I don't think I can stop!

  * [Body Modification Extraordinaire](http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20030401.html) - My friend [AaronX](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/default.htm) sent me this. If the pics are real, then these people are insane.
  * [Virtual Machine Shootout](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/004/software/virtual-machines/vm-1.html) - Here is an interesting article than compares and contrasts MS Virtual PC 2004 with VMWare Workstation 4.5. It appears that VMWare has passed VPC in terms of raw performance.
  * [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/articles.html) - Alan Smith contacted me with this excellent link containing a number of wonderful papers and articles by Gregor Hohpe. Most interesting to me are [Enterprise Integration Patterns with BizTalk Server 2004](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/integrationpatterns_biztalk.pdf)&nbsp_place_holder;and [Test-Driven Development in Enterprise Integration Projects](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/TestDrivenEAI.pdf). Wow.
  * [SGen: Strongly Typed XML Serialization](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/08/02/SGen.aspx) - This article by Daniel Cazzulino has been sitting in my RSS inbox for a couple of days, and I finally got around to reading it. Good stuff. I can't wait to try it out.
