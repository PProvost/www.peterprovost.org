Last week sometime, [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder), [Scott Densmore](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/) and I were inteviewed by [Ron Jacobs](http://www.ronjacobs.com/) about our experiences in the "Delta Lounge." That is the name we had for the warroom in which we built Enterprise Library. 

Ron has posted it to [his postcast page](http://www.ronjacobs.com/podcast/default.htm). Go give it a listen. Part 2 should be up soon.
