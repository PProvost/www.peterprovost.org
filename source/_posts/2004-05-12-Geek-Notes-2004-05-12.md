  * [WiX For Dummies](http://weblogs.asp.net/lorenh/archive/2004/05/09/128899.aspx) - Loren Halverson shares his teams tricks for using WiX to make MSI files. Sounds like they have made it work for them. [via [The ServerSide.NET](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=25821)]

Interesting idea... probably not far off. [via [DevHawk](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d7e6ec20-9e24-4d24-b625-9e6f84305f66)]
  * [Riddle Me This Google](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/05/11/130128.aspx) - Eric Lippert spent some serious time mining his web server logs for interesting Google searches that let to his blog. Then he spent way too much time answering some of the weirder questions. Very funny.
