[Brian Button](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/oneagilecoder/), [Scott Densmore](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/), [Brad Wilson](http://www.dotnetdevs.com/) and myself are putting on a webcast about TDD this Thursday. Here is [a link to the webcast](http://www.microsoft.com/events/EventDetails.aspx?CMTYSvcSource=MSCOMMedia&Params=%7eCMTYDataSvcParams%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ID%22+Value%3d%221032271589%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ProviderID%22+Value%3d%22A6B43178-497C-4225-BA42-DF595171F04C%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22lang%22+Value%3d%22en%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22cr%22+Value%3d%22US%22%2f%5e%7esParams%5e%7e%2fsParams%5e%7e%2fCMTYDataSvcParams%5e) if you want to attend. 

One thing to note: this was originally scheduled to be a talk by Jim Newkirk about TDD in VSTS, but he is unavailable so we are doing one on TDD in general. So the title and description are not really correct. 

The title should be: 

> **Test-Driven Development  
**_A gentle introduction to TDD from a bunch of patterns & practices zealots._

If you are interested in hearing war stories from us, please come and listen in. 

UPDATE: Apparently there is some confusion around the time. It is at 11:00am Pacific time. See you then!
