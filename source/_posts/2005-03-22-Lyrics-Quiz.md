Ever listen to a song a hundred times and not really catch the lyrics? Well it happens to me all the time.

I caught these tonight while listening to my iPod Shuffle and loading the dishwasher. Cool words.

Without using Google, I wonder if anyone (other than [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/)) knows what the band/album/song is?

> The music of the future  
Will not entertain  
It's only meant to repress  
And neutralise your brain
> 
> Soul gets squeezed out  
Edges get blunt  
Demographic  
Gives what you want
> 
> Now the sound of music  
Comes in silver pills  
Engineered to suit you  
Building cheaper thrills
> 
> The music of rebellion  
Makes you wanna rage  
But it's made by millionaires  
Who are nearly twice your age

Good luck!
