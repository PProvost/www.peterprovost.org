I just finished reading the so-called ["banned chapter" from Kevin Mitnick's new book](http://www.iggyz.com/KevinMitnick.html). I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, Kevin (now out of jail) is about to publish a book about social-engineering called [The Art of Deception](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471237124/peterprovosto-20). Well, just before the book was due to be published, the first chapter was pulled. It says many not-so-nice things about the people who helped to bring Kevin down.

Anyway... you should read it. It doesn't take long and it is an interesting first-person account of how Kevin ended up in jail.
