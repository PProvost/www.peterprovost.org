Near the end of the development cycle for Visual Studio 2012, a group of folks
in the VSALM team (led by my very creative manager Tracey Trewin) came up with
this cool animated video introducing some of the great new features in Visual
Studio 2012 Ultimate. I think it is pretty cool, and even pretty funny, so I
wanted to share it with you all.
