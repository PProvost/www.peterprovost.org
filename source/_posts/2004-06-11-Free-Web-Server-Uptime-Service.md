In my last post I begged for a free service to notify me if my web server goes down. Keith Brown [commented](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/10/1360.aspx#1371):

> I was about to recommend Phil Greenspun's free "uptime" service at uptime.arsdigita.com/uptime, but hey, arsdigita.com is dissolved 

Well, Keith didn't look hard enough becuase Phil's system is still up and running, but the URL has changed.

It is now running at [http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/](http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/)&nbsp_place_holder;and I have registered my server. Thanks Keith and for anyone else looking for this kind of thing, that looks like a pretty good server.

(Of course it could just be an email address collector for spam, but I don't think so.)
