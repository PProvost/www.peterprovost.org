So I spent an hour this evening stitching these photos in Photoshop. Used the [technique described here](http://www.nickgallery.com/web_pages/technical%202.htm) to do it and it worked fairly well... good enough for me.

Pretty amazing job those guys did. They finished the whole job in 4 days. We love it.

Before:

And after:

Hard to believe it is the same yard.

UPDATE: Someone asked me who did the work for us and the answer is [Superior Sprinklers](http://www.superiorsprinklers.com/). I would recommend them to anyone.
