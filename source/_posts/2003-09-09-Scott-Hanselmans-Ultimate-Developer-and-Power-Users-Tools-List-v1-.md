Wow. Scott has posted the [contents of his C:\UTILS folder](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/stories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html). Quite a list. I use about half of those regularly. Now I just need to review the rest and see what I need. I'm sure I'm missing something.
