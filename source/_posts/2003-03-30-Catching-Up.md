Didn't do any blogging yesterday. [Emily](http://www.provost.org/emily-provost.asp) was sick and when I wasn't taking care of her and [Hadley](http://www.provost.org/the-kid.asp), I was at the new office helping move my company. We are moving from 2701 Blake St. to 1320 27th St. It is only two blocks but we get twice as much space for the same rent.

I a couple of previous posts ([here](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/03/15.html#a112) and [here](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/03/22.html#a154)), I talked about the construction we did over there. Well, the painting is 100% complete, but we have to be in Monday, 'cause that's when the phone and data circuit moves. I'm ready for this to be over so I can get back to thinking about writing cool apps for people.

I may head in to the new office to build my desk and try to set up a few things, but I might not have time. We'll see.
