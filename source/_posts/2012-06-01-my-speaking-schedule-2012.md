I tweeted a bit about the craziness coming up for me in June, but I realized
today that I've not posted the whole schedule. So if you're interested and
wondering what I'll be talking about, here's the complete list (in chonological
order).

The first two are now behind me, but the twin TechEds are coming up fast. Also,
I've got a couple that are currently "maybes" so once they are confirmed I'll
update this post. If you want to contact me about speaking at an event, please
use my about.me contact page.

**Update 2012-06-06** - I had to pull out of Agile.NET Columbus due to a
conference date change that wasn't compatible with my schedule. Bummer.
