Has anyone found the HOL content online anywhere? I found the ASP.NET Whidbey HOLs on the [ASP.NET Site]((http://www.asp.net/whidbey/pdc.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1), but I'd like to find the rest... particularly the Longhorn labs.

Please tell me they will be posted somewhere... they're just Word docs!

UPDATE: Benjamin [pointed out in the comments](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=D959BAEE-BC4A-4C7C-B92F-5F9A85CE120C) that if I had dug a little deeper into MyMsEvents.com I would have found them. Thanks!
