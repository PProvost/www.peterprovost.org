I do a&nbsp_place_holder;lot of ADO.NET programming... it seems that almost every project I do has some in it. There have been a bunch of different documents floated around since ADO.NET came out, but [this one](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnadonet/html/adonetbest.asp) looks to be a nice summary. It covers everything from managing connections properly, dealing with XML, parameters and other good stuff.
