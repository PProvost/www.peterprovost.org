My wife had our second child, Finn Mansfield Provost Thursday morning at 5:11am. He weighed in at 6lbs 1oz and was 18├é┬╛ inches long.

Mom and baby are both healthy and happy.

We were scheduled to induce Thursday evening, but Finn decided on Wednesday afternoon that it was time to join the world. The labor was far easier on both mommy and baby than our first was, which made for a much easier experience for me (and after all, it is all about me, right?).

I'll post pictures soon.

PS. I'm doing dial-up from the hospital... I forgot how painfully slow it is.
