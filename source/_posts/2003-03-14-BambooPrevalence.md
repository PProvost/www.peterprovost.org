In [this post](http://pinetree-tech.com/weblog/archives/2003/03/14.shtml#000237) on [News from the Forest](http://pinetree-tech.com/weblog/), Justin mentioned [Bamboo.Prevalence](http://bbooprevalence.sourceforge.net/), and object prevalence engine. What an exciting thing! I've often predicted to people that someday we would move past RDBMSes and just keep everything in RAM. I test-drove a C++ OODBMS that behaved like a RAM-based system using page-fault handlers a few years ago, but it was just too damn expensive.

[Bamboo.Prevalence](http://bbooprevalence.sourceforge.net/) is a .NET implementation of [Prevayler](http://www.prevayler.org/index.jsp). I'm going to have to play with this. It is a tantalizing idea. Thanks Justin for bringing this to my attention.
