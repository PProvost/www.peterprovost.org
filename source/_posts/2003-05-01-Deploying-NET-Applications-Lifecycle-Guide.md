Another excellent item from [Larkware News](http://www.larkware.com/):

> [_Deploying .NET Applications: Lifecycle Guide_](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=52637218-7F17-4E0B-9E62-61D698BF0EE1)_ - This one has actually been out for most of a year now, but I didn't know it existed until I ran across it at MS-Italy of all darned places (link is to the US version, which should be faster for most of my readers). 142-page PDF book of deployment advice from Microsoft. Everything from how to run the deployment process to strategies for installing distributed applications. _
