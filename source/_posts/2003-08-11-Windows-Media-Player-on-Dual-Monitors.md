Windows Media player does something strange when you run on a dual monitor setup. Suppose you are watching a web demo that has the WMP Video Control embedded on the page. When the presentation starts, the video comes up full screen on the second monitor! The same thing happens with non-web-enabled WMP video content. So if you double-click on an AVI file, you will see it in a small WMP window on one monitor and full-screen on the other.

Does anyone know how to stop this behavior? Ideally it should be something I can control on the fly. It is very annoying when you don't want it, but useful when you do want it.
