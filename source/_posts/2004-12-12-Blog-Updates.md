My wife was kind enough to give me a couple of hours off from the kids so I decided to do some work on my blog.

I've been wanting to do a couple of things for a while now:

  1. Add a CAPTCHA for comment spam control
  2. Add a calendar control
  3. Update the skin this one is boring

Well I got 1 and 2 done, and got a start on 3.

I was afraid that I was going to have to write my own CAPTCHA since [the one Scott Hanselman found](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=99b2e3e9-5597-4883-a015-d77c3246a2a8) is for dasBlog and not .TEXT, but I got lucky instead and found [this killer little control](http://roudybob.net/archive/2004/11/11/1631.aspx) ready to go. Works like a charm.

Then I went looking for a calendar control. I always liked those, dumb though they are. It didn't take me long to find one of those either. Scott Willeke [wrote a nice one as an ASCX file](http://blogs.pingpoet.com/overflow/archive/2004/02/14/304.aspx) (no DLL) that works marvelously. If you are viewing this with a browser, then you should see it. I dig it.

As for the skin, I've mostly been brainstorming some ideas. Next I will prototype in Photoshop (or something) and eventually I'll work it into .TEXT. Don't wait up for it I'm notoriously slow on these kinds of things. ![](file:///C:/Program%20Files/BlogJet/Data/Smiles/smile8.gif)
