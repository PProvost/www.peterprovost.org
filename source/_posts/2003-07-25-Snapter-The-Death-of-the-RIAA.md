Cringley has [an interesting idea](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030724.html). I don't know if he came up with it himself or if he pirated it from someone else, but the idea seems to have merit. Basically he proposes a publicly held company where each shareholder has one share. The company owns every CD in existence. The shareholders, using the fair use clause of copyright law, keep backup copies of the CDs at home.

Down with the RIAA!

Thanks to "AaronX" for sending me this tidbit.
