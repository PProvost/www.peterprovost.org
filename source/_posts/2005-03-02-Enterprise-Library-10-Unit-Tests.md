One thing that we spent a lot of time on during the development of Enterprise Library was the unit tests. In fact, for the most part, we tried to use Test-Driven Development (TDD) to help ensure good code coverage. 

As [Brian Button](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/oneagilecoder) discusses in Febrary 2005 issue of Better Software, one of the other advantages to using TDD is that you get a form of developer documentation (e.g. working examples) that by definition can't fall out of date as the code changes. 

But I have to admit I've been surprised that I haven't seen much talk in the blogsphere about the unit tests in EntLib. So a few questions to anyone who is working with EntLibΓÇª

  * Are the unit tests in Enterprise Library 1.0 valuable to you?
  * What was good? What was bad?
  * Did you run them when you got the code?
  * Have you referred to them while exploring the EntLib code?
  * If you've made changes to the EntLib code, did you update the unit tests? If not, why not?
