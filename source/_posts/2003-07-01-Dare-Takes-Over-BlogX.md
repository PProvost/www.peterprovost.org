Just got this email:

> Short Version: Due to a heavy workload Chris Anderson has handed over management of the BlogX project to me, Dare Obasanjo. More details about my plans for BlogX going forward are provided in the links below.

Good luck Chris. Hope you get out of the weeds soon. And thanks Dare for taking over.
