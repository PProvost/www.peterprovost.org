I head about this on NPR this morning, although [this post](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2796607.stm) is from BBC. Apparently they trained it to unscew a jar full of shrimp to entertain the gawkers. Depending on how tightly the lid is, it can take anywhere from 10 seconds to an hour to get it open.
