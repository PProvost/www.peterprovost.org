Don Smith, one of our Product Managers, has put up a few blog posts looking for feedback about how we engage with you. He is asking questions about things like: 

  * How do you feel about the written part of our guidance?
  * How do you feel about having to join a site to access our stuff?
  * Do you want live source code access or just periodic releases?
  * Do you want access to the work queue and bug list? Would you submit bugs and feature suggestions?
  * Do you prefer web forums, mailing lists, or RSS feeds to stay informed and to talk to other people about p&p deliverable?
  * How do you feel about wikis as a way of providing and managing documentation content?
  * What can we do better to communicate more effectively with you, our customers?

Anyway, instead of posting a reply here, please go over to these two posts on Don's blog and give him feeback on his questions. 

  * Post #1 - [It's all about community](http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/archive/2006/09/02/736299.aspx)
  * Post #2 - [Written guidance neccessary?](http://blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/archive/2006/09/03/737644.aspx)

Thanks for taking the time to help us out on this. It makes a difference.
