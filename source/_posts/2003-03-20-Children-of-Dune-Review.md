I just finished the final installment of [Children of Dune](http://scifi.com/dune/) on the SciFi channel. I have to say it was pretty good. They took some interesting liberties with the story, but nothing too bad. Most of the changes were to compress the timeline to make it fit in a six hour miniseries. SciFi is showing the whole thing again this Sunday, so if you missed it, check it out then.
