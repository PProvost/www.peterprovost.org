BillG is quoted in [this article on C|Net](http://rss.com.com/2100-1024_3-1020660.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) about Microsoft's new anti-spam crusade. I'm glad that we're starting to see some major players in this arena, but I can't say I'm all that impressed with anything they have done yet. The software vendors all seem to be taking a whitelist or blacklist approach to spam management, but I just don't believe that will work.

What we really need is a change to the way email is delivered. It is time for SMTP to be updated. It needs a challenge/response system built in to the protocol.

Until then, the only spam filter that REALLY works is [SpamBayes](http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/spambayes/).
