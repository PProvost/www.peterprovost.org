I completed my part of the final deliverable for my current project today. And I start a new one tomorrow. Oh the life of a consultant. :)

I've got a couple of articles in the works, but they've been sitting unfinished. Hopefully I'll be able to get back to them in the next couple of weeks. One is the final wrap-up of my dasBlog to .TEXT conversion. The other is an article about Unit Testing and .NET Remoting.

  * [Improving .NET Application Performance and Scalability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/scalenet.asp) - This looks good. I just wish I could read online better, but I get a headache. Maybe I can scrounge up a paper copy at the local MS office.
  * [Deconstructing ASMX](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-05-16T08:01:07Z) - Don Box tells us the good, the bad and the ugly about the current state of .NET web services... and hints about the future.
  * [Breaking Into Programming](http://gendotnet.com/blog/archive/2004/05/16/181.aspx) - Kathleen Dollard offers 14 suggestions for young people interested in breaking into the business.
  * [FlexWikiPad 0.90](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=aa0a9bf2-8dd0-4656-925b-2ef5eb5f417b) - Craig Andera is almost to 1.0 on FlexWikiPad, his standalone wiki/notepad tool. I've been watching the progress of this for a while. I think maybe it is time to install it.
  * [Deals2Buy Hot Coupons](http://www.dealstobuy.com/) - A friend over at [MCS](http://www.microsoft.com/services/microsoftservices/cons.mspx) sent me this. It is one of those pages you need to keep an eye on because you never know what you will see. What did I just see? Partition Magic for FREE. McAfee Personal Firewall/VirusScan bundel for FREE. Cool.
