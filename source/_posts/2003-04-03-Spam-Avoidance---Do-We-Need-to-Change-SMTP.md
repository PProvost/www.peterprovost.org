In [this posting](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/04/03#obviousIdeaForSpamAvoidance), [Dave](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/)&nbsp_place_holder;writes about his idea for spam avoidance. Instead of making rules to copy the emails you don't want, copy the ones you do like. 

This sounds remarkably like a manual implementation of the [Receptionist Mail Origination Protocol](http://www.whitelist.com/protocol.html)&nbsp_place_holder;(RMOP), something [I wrote about earlier](http://www.peterprovost.org/2003/03/15.html#a110). I really think that the only way we will truly get rid of spam is with something like this. Maybe we need to build something like RMOP into SMTP. I get almost 100 spam messages a day and if it weren't for [CloudMark SpamNet](http://www.cloudmark.com/products/spamnet/), I wouldn't be able to control it.
