So we are starting to get back into the swing of having a newborn in the house. Having a toddler at the same time is completely different than it was last time. Where we used to nap whenever Hadley would nap, we now can't do that unless both kids are napping. Man... I'm tired.

  * [XSLT Intellisense in VS.NET](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/06/29/168740.aspx) - Daniel Cazzulino reminds us of how to get XSLT intellisense in VS.NET. You can do the same thing for other schemas if you want to spend the time.
  * [GMail Agent API](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/gmailagent.asp) - I didn't know that GMail had an API... I've gotta play with this. [via [James Avery](http://dotavery.com/blog/archive/2004/07/07/1567.aspx)]
  * [NUnit 2.2 Beta 2 Released](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=389404) - Charlie and co. are almost ready to release the next version of NUnit. And they have [revamped the package structure](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=389412) too, if you care.
  * [XmlInclude Is Neat](http://pluralsight.com/craig/archive/2004/07/08/1580.aspx) - Craig Andera shows us a neat trick you can do with XmlInclude... and then cautions us not to do it.
  * [SQL Server and Delegation](http://pluralsight.com/keith/archive/2004/07/08/1586.aspx) - Keith Brown, security gury and fellow Denver-ite, has a nice post about SQL Delegation that all developers should read.
  * [Xml Serialization Handler](http://integralpath.blogs.com/thinkingoutloud/2004/07/xml_serializati.html) - Remember Craig Andera's [The Last Configuration Handler I'll Ever Need](http://www.pluralsight.com/craig/articleview.aspx/CLR%20Workings/The%20Last%20Configuration%20Section%20Handler%20I.xml)? Jeff Newsom has taken it one step further. Now maybe this really is the last one we'll ever need. [via [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-07-09T04:54:05Z)]
  * [Fancy log4Net Appenders](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b04ee603-c73d-4320-973d-59977a16d23d) - Scott Hansleman shows us how to create custom pattern layouts, pattern parsers and pattern converters to make log4net do exactly what we want.
