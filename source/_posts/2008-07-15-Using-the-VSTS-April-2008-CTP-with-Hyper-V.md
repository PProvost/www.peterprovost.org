I found this little gem out there today: 

[How Steve Got Burned Today: How To: Get the TFS "Rosario" April 08 CTP running under Hyper-V](http://sstjean.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-to-get-tfs-april-08-ctp-running.html)

Running VPC images in Hyper-V requires some tweaking here and there, and Steven St Jean has figured it all out for you. Since our April 2008 CTP ships as a VPC, those of you wanting to run it in Hyper-V should take a look at this. It is also useful information if you're doing this with other VPC images.
