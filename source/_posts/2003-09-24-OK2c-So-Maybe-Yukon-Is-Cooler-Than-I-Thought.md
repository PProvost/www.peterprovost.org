Let me clarify that subject line... I know Yukon is cool. I know it will change the way we work with SQL Server.

But honestly, I just wasn't as excited about it as I am about Indigo, Avalon and Whidbey. Just my 2 cents... I'm really interested in seeing if the XML support in Yukon does what I want (XPath in the WHERE clause?), but other than that I have just felt ambivalent.

BUT! I have to admit, [this](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/tims/permalink.aspx/d98b62ed-686b-485b-b82b-b9f2f32b3bf1) looks very cool. If I can take my own C# data types and use them as columns in the database, that is VERY cool.
