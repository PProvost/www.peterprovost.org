So now you all know that I'm heading to PAG. I've had a few people around here ask me "So what's the deal with the Application Blocks?"

Ummm... I'm sorry. We didn't talk about that during my interview. :)

But yesterday [Sandy Khaund posted a nice write up](http://weblogs.asp.net/sandyk/archive/2004/08/10/212165.aspx) of how the App Blocks and Enterprise Library fit together, so maybe that will help explain.

  * [Web Messenger](http://webmessenger.msn.com/) - This looks like an interesting way for people to do MSN&nbsp_place_holder;IM when their employer foolishly bans IM. [via [Denis Bauer](http://www.denisbauer.com/weblog/PermaLink,guid,fc7f1962-9cc0-453a-a957-5c42b98efde1.aspx)]
  * [Mafia: The Game ](http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.WhatIsMafia)- Last night at the Denver Pragmatic Programmers meeting, we finished a bit early and Keith Brown showed us how to play this game. It was a blast. Now Keith is trying to start a [Mafia Club](http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.MafiaClub) here in Denver. Too bad I'm moving...
  * [BizTalk Documentation Update](http://b5c2-2018aff2823d/) - Looks like they've updated the product docs again. (Also the [Tutorials](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9c64562c-3fa7-49ba-885e-82213d00776e), [IW Product Docs](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9f718376-28db-498e-989a-008728f41840) and the [Installation Guide](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9f718376-28db-498e-989a-008728f41840).) I wonder why this needs to be updated every month?
  * [TiVo Saves Bomb Suspect](http://techdirt.com/articles/20040810/1229235.shtml) - This guy was accused of having a bomb in his suitcase... until he showed the cops some video from his TiVo showing him using the device (a microphone) on the Craig Kilborn show. LOL
  * [Windows XP SP2 on BitTorrent?](http://techdirt.com/articles/20040810/1216214.shtml) - They're gonna try to get it onto the big distributed file sharing network. Why not?
  * [Werner Vogels Joins Amazon](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000492.html) - The big Dutchman is leaving Cornell and headed to Amazon. Congrats Werner! Since he is moving to Seattle, maybe I'll bump into him there. I hope so. He and I spent most of the [2004 PDC Party](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000316.html) hanging out with Harry Pierson getting drunk. That was a blast.
