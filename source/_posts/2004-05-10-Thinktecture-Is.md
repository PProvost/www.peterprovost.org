...[now live](http://www.thinktecture.com).

Let the questioning begin. I have been expecting exactly what happened and consequently have been thinking about this post for a few days.

There is no way that I will be the only one to ask this question, but when a company forms with four German and Austrian Regional Directors*, some of whom are also MVPs**, do we now have a situation where one external consulting company holds too much power? Remember that RDs have access to more internal MS stuff than probably any other external group. Many RDs are also of various PACs (Partner Advisory Councils). And two of these guys are also MVPs.

If I owned a consulting company in Germany or Austria, I would be screaming foul. Sure, the RD and MVP recognitions are given to the person and not the company, but I don't think MS ever envisioned this.

Now, that said I wish them nothing but the best. I wouldn't be surprised if a few of them lost their RD status over this, but I wouldn't wish that on them. They don't compete in my market, so go out there and slay them.

Just don't move to the Rocky Mountains and we'll be cool... ok?

* Ingo Rammer, Christian Nagel, Christian Weyer and Ralfs Westphal are all RDs according to the [RD Search Site](http://www.microsoftregionaldirectors.com/Public/rdFind.aspx)  
** Christian Nagel and Christian Weyer are both MVPs according to the [MVP Members Site](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;mvpaward&style=toc)
