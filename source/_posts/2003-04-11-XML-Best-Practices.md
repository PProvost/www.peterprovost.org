I just finished reading all three of Aaron Skonnard's excellent .NET XML Best Practices papers. Even if you are very familiar with XML in .NET, you should read these papers. [The first one](http://www.softartisans.com/softartisans/netpaper-skonnard-best01.html) gives an overview of the different technologies and APIs available. It also have some very nice graphical decision trees that you can use to help make your decision. [The second paper](http://www.softartisans.com/softartisans/netpaper-skonnard-best02.html) focuses on reading XML documents, while [the third](http://support.softartisans.com/kbview.aspx?ID=675) is about writing XML documents. Must read.
