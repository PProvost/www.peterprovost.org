We closed on our house yesterday and on Thursday the moving truck arrives. I'm taking Thursday and Friday off, so don't be too suprised if I don't blog until late weekend at best. 

But then again, our Internet should be turned on Thursday, so maybe I will... we'll see.

  * [$pelling Micro$oft with a Dollar $ign](http://weblogs.asp.net/sandyk/archive/2004/09/28/235539.aspx)&nbsp_place_holder;- Sandy Khaund enlightens a member of the ignorant open-source masses. It amazes me how many of these people rattle off FUD like "With MS I get vendor lock-in, but with Java I don't."
  * [Google Building Custom Mozilla Browser](http://www.kottke.org/04/09/more-google-browser) - I don't really understand what they would have to gain, but then it is open-source so why the hell not? [via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/21/google_building_cust.html)]
  * [Motorola and ATTWS Announce MPx220](http://promo.motorola.com/pb03/landingpage_flash.html) - I have an MPx200 and love it. I'm worried that the 220 will cost me $500 or more, but I really want the Bluetooth support. [via [Dustin Smith](http://weblogs.ilg.com/dsmith/archive/2004/09/30/506.aspx)]
  * [Is Your Battery Dead?](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/09/30/236193.aspx) - I know mine is. It always is. As Brad Abrams points out in this post, the battery industry is not fortunate enough to be meeting [Moore's Law](http://www.intel.com/research/silicon/mooreslaw.htm). And it's not looking like they're going to do much better in the near future either.
  * [Read a Pile of Science Fiction Books](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/09/24/12197.aspx) - Sam Gentile lists 10 kick-ass SF novels. I've read only half of them... time for a trip to [my new library](http://www.kcls.org/samm/sammhome.cfm). (After I finish reading [The Confusion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060523867/peterprovosto-20) and [Software Factories](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471202843/peterprovosto-20)&nbsp_place_holder;of course.)
  * [AclUIAdapter](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2004/10/04/2636.aspx) - Once a long time ago, I wondered how to display that fancy ACL editor used by Windows. I ended up recreating it, but these days you can just follow the instructions in this post by Keith Brown.
