Reposting Cameron Skinner's post from this morning:

Well the RC build will also be a "Go Live" build. That essentially means that we are encouraging you to use the products on production workloads, and if the format of artifacts created with Beta2 bits change in the RC bits, we will handle the migration of that data for you either automatically or through some other means. For the RC build, that will also mean migration from the RC product to the final, RTM product.

It is hard to put the product in production use if you can't be sure that your data will migrate to the final build. Thus the "Go Live" license. For the details around the "Go Live", start with [Beehler's post](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2010/02/08/going-live-with-the-visual-studio-2010-release-candidate.aspx).
