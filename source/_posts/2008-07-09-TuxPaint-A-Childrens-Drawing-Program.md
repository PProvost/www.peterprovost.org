![starter-coloringbook-t](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/TuxPaintAChildrensDrawingProgram_9610/starter-coloringbook-t_3.png)This morning my daughter wanted to stay home and draw while her mother took her brother to the doctor. Since I need to be in the office working today, I said to her, "Let's find a good drawing program for kind for the computer!"

She was gung-ho with that, and a few minutes later we found TuxPaint. As you can see in the screenshot on the right, it has nice big colorful icons, a simple color palette, and is very easy to use. You can also download a number of "stamps" with different shapes, animals, icons, etc.

She's been coloring away now for more than an hour.

If your kids are younger or you need something a bit simpler, you should take a look at Scott Hanselman's [BabySmash!](http://www.babysmash.com/) It is great, but you may want to buy a second keyboard for the kid to bang on. ![Smile](http://messenger.msn.com/MMM2006-04-19_17.00/Resource/emoticons/regular_smile.gif)
