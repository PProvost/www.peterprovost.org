Wes asks:

> _As I was typing code today I realized that I find myself typing CTRL-SPACE a whole lot. Is this just me or do other people do this as well?&nbsp_place_holder; For the people who don't know what this does it either drops down an intellisense list based on the context of where you are typing or if there is only one entry that matches what you have typed it will fill in the rest of you.&nbsp_place_holder; It is always nice to say some key strokes. [_[_Wes' Puzzling Blog_](http://dotnetweblogs.com/Whaggard/)_]_

I certainly do. CTRL+SPACE and CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE are two of my best friends. (If you don't know what the second one does, go to a method in code and try it. You should get an intellisense popup showing the method signature.)
