I guess I've been lucky to have spent most of my career working on one database platform (MS SQL), but for the past week or so I've been dealing with a Sybase ASE 11.x server. The fact that SQL isn't really a standard is very annoying.

[This cheat sheet](http://www.scottferguson.com/pages/SybaseSystem11SQLCheatSheet.pdf), put together by [Scott Ferguson](http://www.scottferguson.com/) really helped me a lot. It is a quick 2 page PDF of showing syntax, built-in functions, etc.

Thanks.
