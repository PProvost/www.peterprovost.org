I was chatting with [Bob](http://weblogs.ilg.com/brumfieldb) about the title for this post and we had a few ideas...

  * Follow The White Rabbit
  * Drink From the Fire Hose
  * Go West Young Man
  * Everyone Else Is Doing It, So Why Not Me?

I finally decided on "Peter Takes the Red Pill" after the meme used by a [number](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/04/15.html#a2766) [of](http://weblogs.asp.net/gad/archive/2004/07/19/187750.aspx) [people](http://blogs.msdn.com/gisli/archive/2003/10/22/32912.aspx) [over](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/jcheyssial/archive/2004/04/16/11586.aspx) [the](http://www.codevoid.net/script/getEntry.aspx?id=60) last few years when they took the same step I'm taking. Last week after reading [Rory's comic](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7285.aspx), I wanted to tell everyone, but I made a commitment to my boss to hold off until they could tell my current client. But that happened today, so...

I am going to Microsoft.

On August 30, I will start my new job as a [Software Design Engineer](http://www.microsoft.com/college/fulltime/sde.asp) ([SDE](http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog/archive/2004/04/05/108012.aspx)) in the [Platform Architecture Guidance Group](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/default.mspx). I will have the pleasure of working directly with [James Newkirk](http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/), [Sandy Khaund](http://weblogs.asp.net/sandyk), [Scott Densmore](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore) and the other PAG SDEs as well as many other amazing people like [Ward Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) and David Trowbridge.

I am leaving [Interlink Group](http://www.ilg.com/) the week prior in order to help move my family to the Seattle area. Interlink has been an amazing home for me and one that I thought I wouldn't leave for a long time. I have worked with an [amazing group of engineers](http://weblogs.ilg.com/) at ILG. It is a wonderful company that&nbsp_place_holder;I am proud to have called home.

But this was an opportunity that I just couldn't pass up.

I've always been a fan of PAG and their work. One thing that the Microsoft Development community had always lacked in the past was good guidance on how to build high quality, enterprise systems. When PAG stepped up and started providing the patterns guides, implementation guides and the Application Blocks, it changed the way developers work on the Windows platform. I can't wait to help further this effort.

I really want to publicly thank my wonderful wife Emily for supporting me in this. As you may know, we had a new baby 3 weeks ago and moving with a toddler and a newborn is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. But Emily agreed to it and is doing an amazing job holding it all together. I love her very much and wouldn't be able to do this without her. Thanks Em.
