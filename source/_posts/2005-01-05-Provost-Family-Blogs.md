A few weeks ago I set up a .TEXT server for my family. My wife had been asking me for a new blog site for a while and my step-mom wanted one too.

So I went ahead and created [blogs.provost.org](http://blogs.provost.org/). My parents have a blog called [The Traveling Grammie and Bompie Road Show](http://blogs.provost.org/grammyandbompie/) and my wife [Emily has one too](http://blogs.provost.org/emily) although she hasn't settled on a title or theme yet.

Probably not very technical, so those of you who read me for geek content probably don't care all that much, but these are all funny people with interesting hobbies and stuff going on, so at least pop over and look around once.

Thanks!
