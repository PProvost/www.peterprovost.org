I just read an excellent article on Paul Therrott's SuperSite for Windows. He got some pretty impressive access to the Windows Server 2003 (formerly Windows .NET Server) development team. It is in three parts, the [first](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp)&nbsp_place_holder;is about the history of Windows NT starting way back in 1988. The [second part](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold2.asp)&nbsp_place_holder;gets into the nitty gritty details about how the Windows development teams actually work.

The third isn't quite ready yet, but it apparently will be about how testing is done on the Windows development teams.

This is a good read for anyone who writes code for a living. Ever worked on a project with more than **5000 developers** and more than **50 million lines of code**?
