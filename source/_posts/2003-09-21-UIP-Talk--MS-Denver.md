> **Utilizing the User Interface Process Application Block**├é ├é ├é

4643 South Ulster Street Suite 700

> Recommended Audience: Developer.

> Developers recognize the need to separate business processing logic from the presentation logic. However, a similar partitioning scheme can be applied to the presentation tier itself to create reusable, scalable user interfaces. This session will introduce the User Interface Process Application Block, a simple yet extensible framework for creating user interface processes that abstract the control flow and state management away from the views and into a processing layer.
