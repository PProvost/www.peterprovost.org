After a number of last minute hiccups, we've finally posted CAB to the GDN Codegallery. We've still got a little more work to do to get the VB.NET version complete, but the C# version is done and posted. 

Notable changes since the October CTP: 

  * Bugs fixes
  * NUnit and VSTS Unit Tests
  * VS Integrated Help Documentation

Please download the installer from the [CAB Codegallery Download](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c) page. 

Thanks to everyone on the team who worked so hard to get this done.
