Tom Hollander posted this some time last week and I missed it.

> We're getting ready to start the planning process for the next release of Enterprise Library for .NET Framework 3.0. So where should we focus our efforts? While we have a few ideas up our sleeves, the best ideas are likely to come from people who are using Enterprise Library on real applications. So don't be shy - tell us what you want!

Please to go to [Tom's blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2006/06/21/641840.aspx) let us know.
