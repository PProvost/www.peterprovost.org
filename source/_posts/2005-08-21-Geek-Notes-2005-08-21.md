I'm really looking forward to this next week in the [PAG War Room](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/07/08/PAGWarRoom.aspx). For the first time, everyone from all three teams (CAB, CBA and EntLib) will be there **at the same time**. This will be where we prove whether this muti-team-war-room experiment works or fails. My hypothesis: Amazing Success.

  * [Python to Lose Lambdas?](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196) - [Brad Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotetguy) sent me this via email. He and I have been Ruby-heads for a while now, but recently saw an Iron Python&nbsp_place_holder;demo by Jim Huygins. From this post it sounds like Guido is simplifying things a bit and getting rid of lambdas. Now if only he'd include Ruby-style blocks and Python will move up a notch in my world. Then he can get rid of that 'self' parameter and the 'tabs as syntactic elements' thing and I'll be really happy.
  * [Multiple Monitors w/ Virtual PC](http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2005/08/17/452726.aspx) - I played around with MaxiVista and VPC a while back but for some reason I didn't come up with this trick. Very nice.&nbsp_place_holder;
  * [Urlograph 1.2](http://www.winwonk.com/utils/Urlograph/) - I've been using this URL shortener for a long time now, but one thing it has always lacked is that when you used it on an Amazon URL,&nbsp_place_holder;you had to add you Associates ID yourself. I suggested to Kim that he fix it and now it is done. One click Associates links in addition to all the other link help. Sweet.
  * [HOWTO Put an Elevator into Express Mode](http://thedamnblog.com/index.php?y=2005&m=07&d=31) - I love trivia like this. Press "Door Close" and your destination floor at the same time and some elevators will go into express mode.
  * [The Whitespace Programming Language](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php) - Speaking of Python, the Python-heads should love this. Whitespace as the ultimate syntactice element. [via [Don Box](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/08/11/14002.aspx)]
  * [Enterprise Library Series on DotNetJunkies](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/Tutorial/29EF3A4F-A0C2-4BB2-A215-8F87F100A9F9.dcik) - The first of a series of articles on DotNetJunkies about EntLib. [via [TSHAK](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/tshak/archive/2005/08/11/131887.aspx)]

**Now playing:** [The Breeders](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=The Breeders) - [New Year](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=New Year&artistTerm=The Breeders)
