WTF? I'm sitting here at the dinner table and my wife is watching Dateline NBC and Matt Lauer is interviewing Madonna. I had to interrupt and hit the 8 second rewind button on the TiVo when I heard Madonna say her new album is "punk rock".

She says, "To me, punk rock is thinking outside of the box."

Ummm... yes that is certainly one part of what punk rock is. But I don't think the new Madonna album meets the other criteria... Matt should have asked the kids down on Colfax with facial piercings.
