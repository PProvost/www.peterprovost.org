**Please take note:** The Denver Pragmatic Practitioners is moving its meetings to the 2nd Tuesday of every month, starting this month, so as not to conflict with another group's scheduled meeting time. Hope to see you all there!

**Topic: **Code Generation

What is code generation? Simply put, it's when programs generate programs, or pieces of programs, on behalf of the developer. We'll discuss what code generation is (and is not), and how to use it in your projects. Why not let the computer do all the grunt work, and save the fun stuff for yourself? :)

We'll also discuss the similarities and differences between code generation and generic programming.

The Denver Pragmatic Practitioners take an informal approach to meeting. We prefer conversations over pizza and beer, so come ready to make some new friends and have a great chat about code generation! Refreshments will be provided.

We look forward to seeing you there!
