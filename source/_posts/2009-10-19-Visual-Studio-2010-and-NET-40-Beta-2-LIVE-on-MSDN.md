[![VS-2010-dotNet4-Logo](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2010and.NET.0Beta2LIVEonMSDN/3F70850C/VS2010dotNet4Logo_thumb.png)](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2010and.NET.0Beta2LIVEonMSDN/613C5D9D/VS2010dotNet4Logo.png)This morning we released to MSDN the [Beta 2 release of Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0 to MSDN](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=151797). See [Soma's blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2009/10/19/announcing-visual-studio-2010-and-net-fx-4-beta-2.aspx) for the official bits. 

There is so much good stuff coming in Beta 2 it is hard to keep track of it all. Over in the Arch Tooling team where I work, we've done a ton of work on increasing the performance of the UML, Layer and Architecture designers we've made. We have also added a BUNCH of new and cool MEF-based extensibility hooks into our designers so customers can add new and interesting features that we may not have thought of.

We've been dogfooding this release (client and server) internally for quite a while now and I have to say I really like it. It feels good, it looks good and it does what I want to do.

Probably the biggest thing people will talk about initially, however is the new SKU changes we're making in 2010. I remember way back before I joined Microsoft I criticized the "role-based" SKU system as not actually aligning with how real teams get work done. As [Brian Harry explains on his SKU changes post](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2009/10/19/vs-2010-licensing-changes.aspx), we've fixed that by adopting a SKU system very similar to that used by Windows and Office:

  * **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate with MSDN**: the comprehensive suite of application lifecycle management tools for software teams to ensure quality results from design to deployment. 
  * **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Premium with MSDN**: a complete toolset for developers to deliver scalable, high quality applications. 
  * **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional with MSDN**: the essential tool for professional development tasks to assist developers in implementing their ideas easily. 

As you can see this is a much cleaner SKU model and we're excited to see how customers respond. 

This Beta 2 release is available on MSDN subscriber downloads NOW and will be generally available on Wednesday October 21. .NET Framework Beta 2 will be released in English, Japanese, German and Arabic. VS Beta 2 will be released in English, Japanese, and German.

There have also been a bunch of updates recently to the [Microsoft Developer Network](http://msdn.microsoft.com/) (MSDN) website. A serious design update and ton of new social networking features should help people get the information they need faster than ever. [Scott Hanselman blogged about it](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ANewMSDNForANewOperatingSystemAndANewDevelopmentEnvironment.aspx) last week.

We all hope you try this release out and give us tons of feedback on how it works for you and your business.
