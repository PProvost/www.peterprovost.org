Only one thing to sayΓÇª

![Tool_10000_Days_Cover](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/Tool_10000_Days_Cover.jpg)The new Tool record [10,000 Days](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000EULJLU&tag=peterprovosto-20&camp=1789&creative=9325) absolutely fucking rocks! On a scale from one to five, **it is a nineteen**.

As you might expect, you can hear the influence that A Perfect Circle has had on Maynard's lyrical and vocal style. It is more pronounced on some songs that others. But then you get a song like Rosetta Stones that is so obviously a Tool song that it almost knocks you down.

It was long wait. Thanks guys for not letting the fans down.
