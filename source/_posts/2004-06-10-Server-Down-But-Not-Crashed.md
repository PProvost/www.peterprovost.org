Oops. It looks like my web server was down since sometime late yesterday afternoon. That is the problem with:

> a) Having your server in your home
> 
> b) Having a two-year old who likes pushing lighted buttons

My daughter Hadley is well known for going in the basement with no other intention that to have a snack of some cat food (ick) and turn off my web server. Then she comes back upstairs. I just don't get it. And if I am busy and don't notice, it can be a day or two before I catch on.

What I need is a free external service that monitors my web server and emails me or IMs me when it has been down for more than 5 minutes. Anyone know of such a thing?
