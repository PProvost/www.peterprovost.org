Glenn Block has joined P&P, replacing [Eugenio Pace](http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/) as Product Manager for the UX Program (home of things like [CAB and the Smart Client Software Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient) and the [Web Client Software Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/websf)). 

Please join me in welcoming Glenn to the team. He will be a great addition and I look forward to working with him. 

See Glen's intro post here: [http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2007/04/21/my-new-role-in-p-p.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2007/04/21/my-new-role-in-p-p.aspx)
