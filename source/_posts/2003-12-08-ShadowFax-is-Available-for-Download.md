Christian Weyer writes a nice long post about ShadowFax. If you are involved in Web Services and Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs), you should: 

  1. [Read Christian't post](http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/posts/41571.aspx)
  2. [Download ShadowFax](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/viewUploads.aspx?id=9c29a963-594e-4e7a-9c45-576198df8058)
  3. Start coding!

In case you don't know, ShadowFax is a reference implementation SOA for .NET produced by the Patterns and Practices team.
