A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of reviewing the design specs for a new Application Block being produced by the Patterns and Practices team. This block is called the "Smart Client Offline Caching Block" and will provide an extensible set of classes for building online/offline systems. They have just published the spec and some early code for review on a [GDN Workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=60dd1bb9-0d1e-45e0-975a-a7f398697344). Check it out.

This is one of many new App Blocks and code samples being produced by the P&P; team, so keep an eye open for all the new releases. 

Note: This is a pre-alpha release, so be warned! This is for review and experimentation only.
