I promised the people who attended my "Building Quality .NET Solutions" seminar that I would post the slides, the NAnt files and the Cruise Control config files to my weblog.

You can [download the files here](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/Building_Quality_DotNET_Solutions.zip).

Thanks to everyone who came to the class. It was a lot of fun to teach and hopefully you all found it useful.

(The Colorado Springs class will be on Monday June 21, but I wanted to post the files now for the Ft. Collins and Denver folks).
