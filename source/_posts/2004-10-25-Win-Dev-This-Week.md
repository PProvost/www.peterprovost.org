[Win-Dev](http://butrain.bu.edu/windev/default.asp) is this week, and as a reminder to my regular readers, I will be giving two talks in the [CLR/C# track](http://butrain.bu.edu/windev/track2.asp):

  * Refactoring Support in the Whidbey IDE (Thursday 3:30pm-5:00pm)
  * Effective Unit Testing in C# (Friday 3:30pm-5:00pm)

If you're going to be in Boston for this, drop by and say hello. I don't arrive until Wednesday evening, though, so if you're there already have fun!
