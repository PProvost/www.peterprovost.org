I've long been a fan of the whole Zero Inbox idea. While the concept of
using other kinds of task lists (e.g. Outlook Tasks, Trello or Personal 
Kanban) is nice, in my experience the Inbox is a much more natural place
to keep track of the things I need to do. I don't think this is just a
"Microsoft PM" thing, but certainly the amount of email that happens here, 
in this role, makes it more the case.

## Naming rules

My system ends up with a lot of different rules. I like this because it
lets me see in the Outlook Rules Manager what I have. I tried the great
big "Mailing Lists" rule before and it was difficult to keep track of.
This is, of course, me adapting to the capabilities of my tool, but so be
it.

Naming the rules is an important part of keeping track of it all. My 
general rule naming pattern is like this:

`<action> - <criteria>`

Action is typically things like "Move" or "Don't move". Criteria is
typically things like "to:(some mailing list)". I tend to use the 
descriptive name of things in the rule name rather than the email 
address or alias name. This, again, helps me see at a glance my rules
and the priority stack.

## What makes a good rule?

## Important Rules

## Rule Priorities

If you're doing this in Outlook (I can't speak for other tools), it
is important to understand that your list of rules is executed in order,
from top to bottom, only stopping if a rule says explcitly to stop.

This means that it is worth putting a bit of thought into the priority
of the rules so you get expected outcomes from the tool.

Generally my rules fall into a few prioritized buckets:

### 1. Classification

* Tag Personal - from:(family)
* Tag Important - from:(my management)

### 2. Don't move high priority

* Don't move - to:(me)
* Don't move - Meeting invites

### 3. Move mailing lists

* Move - to:(VSALM Champs)
* Move - to:(other internal mailing lists)

### 4. Don't move lower priority

* Don't move - from:(my management chain)
* Don't move - from:(my direct reports)
* Don't move - from:(me)
* Don't move - from:(family)
* Don't move - from:(friends)
* Don't move - from:(other DLs that I don't route to a folder)

### 5. Catch-all move

* Move everything to archive
