Yesterday I left my travel mug at home and since I only have one, I was coffee-less for my drive into work. Sure, I could have stopped at Starbucks and bought a $4 mocha, but I have a hard time justifying paying that much for coffee.

So I stopped at 7-11 to get a Red Bull and notices that they are now carrying [Bawls](http://www.bawls.com/). Before today, the only place I had seen Bawls was on [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/), so I grabbed one.

Mmmmm mmmm good. Tastes like cream soda, with all the caffeine (or more) of a Red Bull.

PS. I know how silly it seems that I will buy an energy drink but not a Starbucks, but that's just the way I feel.
