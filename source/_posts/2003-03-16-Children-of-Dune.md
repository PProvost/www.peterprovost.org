TiVo recorded the first episode of [Children of Dune on SciFi](http://www.scifi.com/dune/) today. I was out and haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've been looking forward to it for quite a while. I firmly believe that the original [Dune series](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441172717/peterprovosto-20) is an important piece of literature. And also one of the best sci-fi reads ever.
