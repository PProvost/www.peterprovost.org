A couple of weeks ago, [I asked if anyone would be interested](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=c06953da-8975-4627-a1f7-7b066b62da60) in participating in a [Pragmatic Practitioners](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?PragmaticPractitioners) group here in Denver. I got a number of interested comments, so I went ahead and emailed [Dave Thomas](http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave). [Gordon](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106046) pointed out that Dave will be here in November, so if he is interested I'll try to setup an inaugural meeting while he is here. I'll post here once I know more.
