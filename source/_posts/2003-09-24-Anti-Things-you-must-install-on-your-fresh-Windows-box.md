[This excellent post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5584cb8c-d684-4d0e-9918-b6891c8660ff) by Scott Hanselman tells you what you need to install when you get home with your brand new computer. Many of us perform this list instinctively, but a large majority of people happily take their shiny new box and plug it into their DSL modem before doing any of this stuff.

DON'T DO IT!

Read [Scott's post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5584cb8c-d684-4d0e-9918-b6891c8660ff) first. Install an [anti-virus system](http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_dwnl_free.php), an [anti-spam system](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/), and an [anti-spyware](http://www.safer-networking.org/) system. If you don't have a dedicated firewall (and maybe even if you do), turn on the [Windows XP built-in firewall](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/using/howto/networking/icf.asp). Not running XP? Install [ZoneAlarm](http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp;jsessionid=1xoXNkbgFSm44zLptl2m4iP15ZxwDT8E1BeQX0efz6Am0tHM6Iiq!-842231668!-1062696904!7551!7552!744931396!-1062696905!7551!7552?lid=home_zainfo).
