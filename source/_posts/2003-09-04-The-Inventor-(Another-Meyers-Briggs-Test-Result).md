Apparently, I am an ENTP - Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving (according to [this test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp)). I ran through the answers pretty quickly using my gut instinct for most of the answers.

D. Keirsy calls this type [The Inventor](http://keirsey.com/personality/ntep.html). Hmmm... I wonder if people who know me agree or not.

Simplegeek asks "Is ENTJ (his type) a good thing or a bad thing?" I wonder the same thing about ENTP.
