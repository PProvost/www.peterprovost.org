Thanks to Wes for doing what I didn't have time to do.&nbsp_place_holder; Wes created an RSS feed for [CodeProject ](http://www.codeproject.com)using the SOAP interface they have. Subscribed.

Update: Code Project has an [official RSS feed here](http://www.codeproject.com/webservices/articlerss.aspx ).
