A while back I posted that I would not be attending the PDC because it was too expensive (I was essentially self-employed at the time).

Well my [new employer](http://www.ilg.com/) has decided to send me! Yippee! I don't think they signed me up for the [PreCon sessions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/precon.aspx), which is too bad, but the rest should be good.

I will be actively blogging during the conference so keep an eye on this site.
