I used to play with MAME (Multipurpose Arcade Machine Emulator) all the time. It was a great way to play the old games. But it wasn't particularly fast on a Windows machine. Too many layers or something...

Now they have combined MAME with Knoppix (a bootable linux CD distro) so you can play all the MAME games without installing anything on your computer. Very cool.
