Took a little break while Chris and Rocky played with the Anchor property. I'm hoping they'll cover something not in _WinForms For Dummies_ at some point. At least they are funny.

Anyway, while not paying attention, I tried to catch up on the 700+ items in SharpReader. [Adam Cartwright is stuck in DIA](http://www.adamc.com/EntryView.aspx?69). He speculates that [the nice fires](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/10/26/california.wildfire/index.html) that I saw last night have actually caused them to issue a ground stop at LAX.

I wonder who else is sitting in here blogging instead of paying attention to WinForms 101?
