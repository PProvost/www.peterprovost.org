Darrell Norton recently [posted a set of responses](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/posts/1947.aspx) to Steve Eichert's [The Skeptics View of Agile](http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/seichert/posts/1883.aspx). I won't reproduce them here, but if you are either├é a skeptic or have had to deal with skeptics in the past, read Darrell's post. Nice work.
