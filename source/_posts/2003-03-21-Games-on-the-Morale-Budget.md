This is crazy!

> [_Halo_](http://halo.bungie.org/)_&nbsp_place_holder;is rapidly becoming a tradition&nbsp_place_holder;at MS.&nbsp_place_holder; All over the company XBOX's are being setup with the sole purpose of playing halo.&nbsp_place_holder; Many teams have their rig subsidized by their morale budget.&nbsp_place_holder; We on the Windows Forms team wanted a more exclusive experience, so we&nbsp_place_holder;started an&nbsp_place_holder;XBOX membership&nbsp_place_holder;program.&nbsp_place_holder; Its like a country club, except without the golfing._
> 
> [_Team High Life_](http://www.seattlesportsleagues.com/Leagues/FlagFootball/Schedule.asp)_&nbsp_place_holder;also has a standing halo tradition.&nbsp_place_holder; We've convened on just about every Wednesday night&nbsp_place_holder;in building 50 since the magic evening of 11/15/01.&nbsp_place_holder; Playing with the Windows Forms team, on a single box is a blast, but there is nothing quite like 4 box, 16 way action.&nbsp_place_holder; Ask _[_ChrisAn_](http://www.simplegeek.com)_, he shows up from time to time._
