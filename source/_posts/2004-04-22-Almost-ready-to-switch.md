So I'm almost done with my dasBlog to .TEXT converter. That's why I haven't been posting much lately. Oh and I'm slammed at a client right now, which doesn't help. 

I've got one person who's going to help me beta test this thing, but I think I'm going to just pull the switch this weekend sometime. So if this blog goes down, please let me know via email so I can fix it. 

I have redirectors in place for the permalinks, for the RSS and ATOM feeds, etc., so hopefully none of you will notice. But it could happen.
