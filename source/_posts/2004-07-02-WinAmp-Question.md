I've recently switch back to WinAmp from Windows Media Player. I'm not going to get into the reasons now, but there is one thing that I want to be able to do that I can't figure out...

Can I link to songs together so that they are logically treated like one song? I'm guessing that the answer is to open the tracks in something like SoundForge and actually join them together, but I don't really like that so much. I would much prefer to be able to choose the tracks and logically join them.

**Now playing:** Tool - Parabol
