I just had a colleague ask me about talking to the Project Data Service (PDS) web services from .NET and found this little sample project: 

[PDS Test.Net Application for Microsoft Project Server](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ef966ad6-8fc6-4c33-8315-ebbe170d6845&DisplayLang=en)

Exactly what I was looking for!
