It's up there folks. Let the rush begin!

UPDATE 2004-07-01 16:15: Mine is pulling a whopping 50KB/sec. This is gonna take a while. Reminds me of when Everett went live. That took days.

UPDATE 2004-07-01 22:35: I'm pulling between 80KB and 140KB/sec here at home. Hopefully I'll have much of it by morning.
