Whew! I spent the week out at a client site doing an Architectural Design Review of a .NET framework that they've been developing for the past year or so. All-in-all I think they did a good job. They still have some work ahead of them (of course), but it is pretty well thought out. 

  * [Does Microsoft .NET measure up?](http://www.infoworld.com/reports/09SRmsnet.html) - This InfoWorld Special Report tries to answer that question. John Udell gives it good grades (As and Bs). What do you think? [via [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-03-02T04:51:55Z)]
  * [The Smart Client Experience](http://weblogs.ilg.com/jshirey/archive/2004/03/01/239.aspx) - Microsoft Regional Director and fellow Interlinker Joe Shirey starts blogging with this post about Smart Clients.
  * [Security in Java and .NET](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/demiliani/archive/2004/03/02/8220.aspx) - The .NET world and the Java world have completely different approaches to how security is implemented. Stefano Demiliani has posted a convenient set of links to four articles from onjava.com that cover configuration, cryptography, code access, and authentication & authorization.
  * [Optimizing Thread Pooling](http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2004/03/02/82778.aspx) - Here is a topic you don't see everyday. And a solution technique that I've never seen before. Rico Mariani tells the store of how he used a [Poisson Function](http://thesaurus.maths.org/dictionary/map/word/1656) to determine what the optimal size of his thread pool was. Very cool technique!
  * [IEEE Plans to Standardize Agility](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2004/03/01#standards-bloody-standards) - Brian Marick rants gently about why the IEEE shouldn't be trying to lock agility into a mold.
  * [Virtual Sex Change](http://boingboing.net/2004_03_01_archive.html#107825320934080559) - Man oh man... this is hilarious. See George W Bush as a woman. See yourself! See your boss!
