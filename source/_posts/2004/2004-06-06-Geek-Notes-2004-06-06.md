So I spent much of the weekend working on my new yard. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a yard with grass again. And the sprinkler system rules. If only Denver would let me turn it on more than twice a week...

  * [Test-first vs. Test-driven Development](http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/TestDrivenOrTestFirst.rdoc) - Dave Thomas makes an interesting distinction between "always write tests before production code" and "use tests to control your design". An interesting distinction, but I don't know why it matters. 
  * [Jazmine Framework for SharePoint](http://sharepointblogs.com/bmixon/archive/2004/05/29/516.aspx) - Bob Mixon has release the framework he's been working on to [a GDN Workspace](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/jazmine). Good work Bob. 
  * [MSDN Subscriber Downloads RSS Feed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/rss.xml) - I don't know how I missed this one. I love the RSS feed for MSDN Downloads and now I can find out when new stuff shows up on subscriber downloads! 
  * [IL Graphing Reflector Add-In](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/05/31/287.aspx) - Wow. I don't really know why I would want a graph of the IL for a routine, but it is neat. 
  * [N-Tier Design is Good](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a0a65e0c-5ef8-41e4-a566-1739b4428aa5) - Scott Hanselman reminds the world why we don't like to build apps with all of the code in the Page_Load event handler. 
  * [Diff Debugging](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DiffDebugging.html) - Martin Fowler is really good at coming up with neat names for unnamed things people already do... like this. What do you do when you find a test failing suddenly? You do a checkout of an earlier build and use diff to figure out what changed. 
  * [Unit Testing in VS2K5TS](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/06/02/146834.aspx) - Jim Newkirk shows the ever-popular "Hello World" using the new unit testing features in Whidbey. 
  * [Genome 2.0](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=26354) - Yet another object relational mapping tool. Jesus... Am I the only one who hasn't released one of these damn things?

And last but not least... [Harry Pierson tips us all off](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e6a1cae1-6262-420a-97d9-539b0113f1b7) to XMLSPY Home Edition, a free version of XMLSMY. Right on. I needed that. Apparently it is missing the graphical WSDL editor, but I can live without that.
