Wow. A whole week has passed since my last post. Oops, sorry. 

I spent most of last week giving .NET training in Woodland Park Colorado. A nice little town, but the commute from Denver was getting old by the third day. Here is some stuff I collected while offline, I'll have more posts soon... 

  * [MSI2XML](http://msi-repackaging.sourceforge.net/) - A cool little tool that converts MSI files to XML files. Good for when you want to have MSI files as text files or when you want to tweak them. It also converts them back to MSI files again.
  * [MSI-Repackaging](http://msi-repackaging.sourceforge.net/) - This an interesting project that collects MSI files (as XML files--see above)--with external file references--for products that don't use MSI. Why would I need this? Well, if you are a sys admin using SMS to push MSI files to workstations, but you have a program that doesn't come with MSI files, then you could use this.
  * [NCover](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?ID=3122EE1A-46E7-48A5-857E-AAD6739EF6B9) - A new code coverage tool. Go check your NUnit tests! (via [Ken Brubaker](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/kenbrubaker/posts/5783.aspx))
  * [BizTalk Server 2004 Generic Adapter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/BTS2004IS/htm/bts2004_gasample.asp) - This article describes a "generic adapter" (with code) which you can use to write your own custom adapters quickly and easily.

Oh and by the way, during my week away from blogging I found out that I have been awarded Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in .NET for my community efforts. Wow. I am honored. Thanks.
