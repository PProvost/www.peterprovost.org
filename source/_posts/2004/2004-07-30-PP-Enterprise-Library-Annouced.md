There isn't a lot of technical information yet, but a few PAG folks have started blogging about the next gen of the Application Blocks... Enterprise Library. Here are a few links with the information that I could find so far:

  * [The Official Announcement at Patterns & Practices](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/comingsoon.mspx)
  * [The Enterprise Library GDN Workspace](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/entlib)
  * [Scott Densmore's Post](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore/archive/2004/07/28/200013.aspx)
  * [Brian Button's Post](http://oneagilecoder.blogspot.com/2004/07/microsoft-enterprise-library.html)

Keep an eye on those sites for more information about the project. The most important thing to note however, is this paragraph:

> The first version of Enterprise Library is being developed by Microsoft in partnership with Avanade. In recognition of Avanade├óΓé¼Γäós role in helping build the foundation of this deliverable, this version will be available to Avanade├óΓé¼Γäós enterprise customers in late 2004 prior to the general release. It will then be released to the general public in early 2005.
