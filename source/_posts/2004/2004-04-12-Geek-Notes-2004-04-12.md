So I think I've finally caught up from the overindulgence that was the MVP Summit. I'm just getting too old to do that 3 or 4 days in a row. :) 

  * [Top Ten Rules of Performance](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/02/10/270.aspx) - I found this link [on Ted Neward's blog](http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20040329#1080604471685). Good stuff worth reading. It has me worried about issues of premature optimization, but at least he talks about using profiling to identify the problem areas.
  * [Poke-Inviting Code](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2004/04/05#feathers-coupling) - This post by testing-guru Brian Marick follows up on an idea [presented originally by Michael Feathers](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=42486): If you really want to see how decoupled your code it, pick a class, any class, and try to instantiate it in a test harness.
  * [BizTalk Server 2004 Tutorial](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9c64562c-3fa7-49ba-885e-82213d00776e&displaylang=en) - The BizTalk Server Tutorial contains detailed information about how Microsoft BizTalk Server 2004 can be used within your company to facilitate Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and among business partners to automate business-to-business processes.
  * [InfoPath 2003 Training](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/odc_2003_ta/html/odc_landinfo03_tr.asp) - Wow! MSDN has released a 15-part training run on developing with InfoPath 2003 SP-1. It looks like it does discuss the new .NET stuff but only cursorily.
  * [Adding Components to the VS.NET Toolbox](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/04/06/vstoolbox) - I can't believe I've been using VS.NET for as long as I have and I haven't tried this. [via [The Daily Grind 342](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind342.html)]

And to wrap this up, let me point you to [Rory's post about the MVP Summit](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/5244.aspx). Yes, I really did do that. My bad. I can't help├é it! I read Rory's post to my wife and she said, "Yeah, you totally are that guy. If someone told you about their fear of dogs, you would tell them some terrible story about a mauling." 

├é 

Great. Even my wife is against me. :)
