As I was driving to my mother-in-law's house this evening to fix her broken DSL I saw a billboard that said: 

"My free lessons are already on your computer!" 

As I drove past I started thinking about what it was saying. It is basically a big fat lie. Why would anyone want to take computer lessons from some schmuck who lied to me about how my computer worked? His f**king computer lessons are NOT on my computer! They are available online, but that is not the same thing. 

Jackass... 

  * [We Are Morons: A Quick Look at the Windows Source](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/15/71552/7795) - [Tim Tabor](http://www.cheztabor.com/) posted a link to this article to WTOT today. What an interesting read. It is a general review of some of the code that has been making news lately. Honestly, it makes me├é want to see that code, but since I don't have it the review will have to do. 
  * [Crimson Room](http://www.datacraft.co.jp/takagism/index_e.html) - Man this damn game is addictive. One room... try to get out! It took me almost an hour, but I did it.[via [simplegeek](http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/60526199-de6e-4e1c-b18b-45fd3b6046fa)] 
  * [Services vs Components](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=111dbe19-123a-497e-99b7-a095bab69465) - Clemens Vasters makes some really good points about what a component is (and isn't) and what a service is (and isn't). 
  * [Premature Optimization](http://billharlan.com/pub/papers/A_Tirade_Against_the_Cult_of_Performance.html) - I was talking with one of our developers today about how so many people have a tendency to prematurly optimize their code. You know, worry about performance "problems" before you actually know where your performance bottlenecks are? Or before you know what your performance requirements are? I've also had a few discussions with Brad Wilson (aka The .NET Guy) about this. Favorite quote? "It is easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code." Good advice.

Oh and one more thing... my wife like me to watch American Idol with her so we can make fun of them together. Well tonight they all SUCKED! I can't believe they let those boring idiots even go on television. The only good part was when they played a Simpsons clip (from the upcoming episode) of Homer punching Simon in the face.
