Today I finished up the framing and got the electrical amost done. I was able to resolve a little circuit problem that has been plaguing us since we bought the house.

  * [Team America World Police](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/team_america/) - The creators of South Park take on everyone in this new flick, due out in October. [via [iamwill](http://iamwill.com/admin/wp/index.php?p=212)]
  * [Resharper 1.0](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html) - JetBrains has finally released Resharper for Visual Studio .NET. I used the beta a bit and really liked it. The most annoying part was that it wouldn't work with CodeRush, so I uninstalled it. I wonder if this one works better? Or I can just wait for CodeRush to add refactoring tools....
  * [Iron Python 0.6](http://www.ironpython.com/) - It looks like this Python implementation for .NET is getting some serious traction. But what I want is a Ruby implementation for .NET instead. When do I get that? [via [Sam Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/07/29/12112.aspx)]
  * [Passwords vs. Passphrases](http://silverstr.ufies.org/blog/archives/000657.html) - Dana Epp gives a nice essay about the ins and outs of passwords and passphrases. Must read.
  * [No More Traffic Jams](http://techdirt.com/articles/20040730/1144234.shtml) - Apparently adaptive cruise control can cure traffic jams by slowing down cars when they get too close to each other. Cool.
