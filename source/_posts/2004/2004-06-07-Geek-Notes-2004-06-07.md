Back to work... back to work. Monday again. Wrote a cool SharePoint utility today. I'll blog it next...

  * [Code Snippets in VS2K5TS](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/06/02/147153.aspx) - In Jim Newkirk's next installment, he shows us how to really take advantage of code snippets in the new Whidbey IDE.
  * [MSDN Threat Modeling Site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/threatmodeling/default.aspx) - In addition to the cool [Threat Modeling tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=62830f95-0e61-4f87-88a6-e7c663444ac1&displaylang=en) I blogged about a few days ago, MSDN now has a site full of Threat Modeling stuff.
  * [MVP-XML](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvp-xml) - I forgot to blog this when it first popped up... a bunch of MVPs have created a set of XML classes that provide functionality to extend the System.Xml namespace.

  * [devMetrics 1.0](http://www.anticipatingminds.com/Downloads/details.aspx?download_id=%7b33772E1D-8D6D-4BE2-BCB5-982876FEB2E1%7d) - Source code metrics add-in for VS.NET [via [The Daily Grind 389](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind389.html)]
