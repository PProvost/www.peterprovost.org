I can't believe it is June already. Where did the spring go? It is already starting to get HOT in Colorado and I'm wishing again that my house had central air conditioning.

  * [VS.NET "Add New Item" Template Compiler](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/Add_New_Item_Installer.asp) - I've needed this in the past. It helps you add new things to the "Add New Item" dialog box in VS.NET.
  * [Make Your NUnit Tests in EXEs Instead of DLLs](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2004/05/22/139507.aspx) - Jamie Cansdale argues that making your test project an EXE might be a good idea.
  * [.NET Reflector Add-In 4.0.3.0](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2004/05/23/139766.aspx) - Jamie has another release of Reflector Add-in... now you can right click and choose "Reflector | Decompile to C#". Neat.
  * [XPQ](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a1bfd611-2f23-450a-9df1-ca6aef11d311) - Run XPath queries against files from the command line.
  * [DevHawk's Dad is Blogging](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=48196bf6-e2e4-4d50-b255-14fc237e41a4) - Harry's dad was on the team that wrote the C programming language. And now he's blogging.
  * [Code Rush is Cool](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7e9ef1ba-5b8c-49cc-85f6-20c4c9c4969f) - So what it everyone else is blogging about this great tool. I can too!
  * [WSE 2.0 Tracing Utility](http://mtaulty.com/blog/archive/2004/05/25/433.aspx) - Now that wizzy-too is out, you may find this tool useful for tracing what is going on in there.
  * [VPN Not Allowed from Tech Ed](http://www.crn.com/components/weblogs/article.asp?ArticleID=50448) - Apparently MS locked out the MS VPN protocol from the Tech Ed floor. I noticed because I couldn't get into my home network from there. But interestingly, I could get into my work network (Cisco VPN).
