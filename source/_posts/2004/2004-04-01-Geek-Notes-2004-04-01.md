  * [System.Xml 2.0 is Cool](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b3d89c73-33f5-4e38-9a73-c85b826f5a94) - Craig Andera thinks [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnxml/html/SysXMLVS05.asp) is cool. I agree. 
  * [Intellisense in NAnt Build Files](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=10a8f7d4-d555-47a1-be68-f68baf9ef4a5) - Scott Hanselman is on a roll with his NAnt build posts. This one is killer if you use NAnt much. 
  * [Creating MSI Installers from NAnt](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=eaab7100-d04b-4f19-bae6-f18e602e6aa4) - Again Scott posts some cool NAnt hacks. Here he uses some nasty regex to avoid the infamous [msitask](http://nant.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/MSITask).
