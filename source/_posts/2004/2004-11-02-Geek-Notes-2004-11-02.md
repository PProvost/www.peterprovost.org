It is Election Day! Will we actually know who our president is tomorrow? Will we know who has a majority in the House and Senate? Somehow I doubt it.

Hopefully you all went out and voted by now. If not, please do. If you are one of those people who thinks that voting is a waste of time, then please go vote for me (I'm Canadian and can't vote).

  * [Living Brain in a Jar](http://www.napa.ufl.edu/2004news/braindish.htm) - Well... not really. But it is an interesting idea. [via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/22/living_brain_in_a_ja.html)]
  * [Has Blogging Gone Too Far](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=cf02015e-f891-47f6-b83b-d94dec6f4ec3) - This one made me laugh out loud.
  * [Segway Centaur](http://origin.www.segway.com/centaur/) - From the guys who brought you the over-prices walking machine, now you can have an overpriced quad-cycle/walking/thingy. The video is cool though. [via [iamwill](http://iamwill.com/admin/wp/index.php?p=269)]
  * [NClassifier](http://nclassifier.sourceforge.net/index.html) - Want Bayesian (or some other) text classification for your .NET app? Look no further. (I can't find a license file though... so if you are license-concerned, ask the project maintainer first.) [via [The Daily Grind 486](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind486.html)]
  * [Cat Tossing in Zero-G](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/24/cattossing_in_zerog_.html) - Man oh man... another hilarious tidbit. There is a little ten-year old boy deep down inside of me that thinks this is the funniest thing in the world.
  * [Hypo-Allergenic Cats](http://www.allerca.com/index.html) - Speaking of cats, Allerca is taking pre-orders for genetically modified cats that may help those who are allergic but want to own a cat. I wonder how many people actually fall into that category? NewScientist.com [doesn't think it will work](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996594) however, so you may want to carefully consider before you fork over your dough.
