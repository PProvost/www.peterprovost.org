It has been coming for a while now, but as of this morning, [NewsGator Online Services](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/default.aspx) is now free.

It is all outlined in [today's press release](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=48).

What this means is that you can now have a few things for free that you used to have to pay for to have with NewsGator. 

  * My Clippings - A central place to manage and store posts you want to review (or blog) later.
  * Multi-Computer Sync - Now I can keep my NG at home in sync with my one at work.
  * Web Edition - Not at your regular computer? Hit the website!

Although you could get these from various free tools like Bloglines or RSSBandit, I'm really excited to get this stuff all wrapped up into one (supported) product that also has Outlook support. Can't beat that.

Now, they haven't actually revved the Outlook client yet, so the My Clippings feature is somewhat crippled in that you can't easily copy a post to it from Outlook. But hopefully they will push out a new version of the client soon with that (and hopefully a lot more) feature.
