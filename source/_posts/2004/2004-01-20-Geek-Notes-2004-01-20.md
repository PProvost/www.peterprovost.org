At the Denver Pragmatic Practitioners meeting last night, I had an interesting chat with [Brad Wilson](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/) and others last night about blogging, wikis and such. Brad and I are both leaning toward moving to a wiki with an RSS feed instead of a blog engine. My blogging has really become these once a day posts which are fun, but since I stopped working on my old wiki, I haven't had a place to write articles. I've heard rumours that dasBlog will support articles soon, but as far as I know, it doesn't yet. 

Brad suggested I check out [FlexWiki](http://www.flexwiki.com/). I'll let you know what I decide. 

  * [10 Better Questions for Don Box](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1016) - A few weeks ago Chris Sells posted that he thought Don hadn't been asked very good questions in an interview. After collecting questions from a number of people, Chris has decided on the 10 that he would send to Don. Now we just have to wait for the answers.
  * [Niobe](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?ID=E7071B93-7970-4962-A4C2-D72AA2CFBCFF) - A framework for generating Addins for Outlook 2003. I don't really get it... I could do that without this. An what about Extended MAPI? Let's see you do that with managed code. (via [The Daily Grind 276](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind276.html))
  * [Smoke Kills](http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~tukkers/GoT/antimult011-smokekills.swf) - I forgot on whose weblog I originally found this Flash movie, but it is hilarious. A variation on the "a butterfly flaps its wings and..." theme.
  * [Caching Implies Policy](http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2004/01/19/60280.aspx) - In this excellent little post, Rico Mariani discusses the side effects that caching has on your code and your design. Not that caching is bad, just that you need to think about it.
  * [Han Solo Frozen in Lego](http://www.nathanbrickartist.com/archives/000018.html) - Yes. Someone actually took the time to recreate the Han Solo in carbonite sculpture from the original Star Wars trilogy. In Lego. "It took about 10,000 bricks, almost all dark gray, and about the months..." (via [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2004_01_01_archive.html#107453504904706125))
