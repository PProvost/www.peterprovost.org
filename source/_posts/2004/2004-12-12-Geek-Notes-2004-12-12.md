We've have a couple weeks of straight rain, but yesterday was mostly sunny and it is looking like today could be nice. One can only hope. (Although as my friend [Kris Syverstad](http://weblogs.ilg.com/ksyverstad/) will remind me I was warned.)

  * [Google Suggest Beta](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en) - An interesting twist on search engines it pops up a drop down list and suggests as you type.
  * [Usenet Timeline](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html)&nbsp_place_holder;- I ran into this a while ago. It is a chronology of some of the more interesting things in USENET. A few favorites of mine are [MS Needs Wizards](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/net.jobs/browse_thread/thread/931a1f4c1da6967) (1984), [The Morris Internet Worm](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.protocols.tcp-ip/browse_thread/thread/b19e7420655f15b7) (1988), [WWW Project Announcement](http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=6487%40cernvax.cern.ch) (1991), [Linus' Linux Announcement](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/browse_thread/thread/e3df794a2bce97da) (1991), [Andy Tanenbaum vs. Linus Torvalds](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/browse_frm/thread/c25870d7a41696d2) (1992), [Google Acquires DejaNews](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.usenet/browse_thread/thread/129d92bc5e3c684c) (2001)
  * [A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0830823794/qid=1102748554/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/103-2127017-4726236?v=glance&s=books&n=507846\) - This book came up on the suggested list at Amazon while my wife was searching for Christmas toys. I have a number of gay friends who I wouldn't change a bit, so this makes me feel annoyed and not really want to shop there anymore.
  * [I'm Test-Driven Logo Programme](http://www.testdriven.com/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=1#programme.) - This has been discussed on the Test-Driven Mailing List for the past couple of weeks. Put one of these logos on your site or blog and tell the world that you are Test Driven!
  * [Recall This Message Doesn't Work](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=19e07df8-de41-4c26-b903-ca70d20b97a9) - I literally laughed out loud when&nbsp_place_holder;I read this post by Scott Hanselman. It is so true. If you are the kind of person who might need to recall a message because you change you mind, then maybe you should implement a delay rule on your outbox.
  * [Road Rage Cards](http://roadragecards.com/) - Hahahaha I've wanted something like this for years. Rather than pay $20 however, I think I'll just make my own.
