Today I added a rating system a la the one at MSDN so you can rate my posts. Should be interesting to see if I get any meaningful data out of it.

The original idea came from [Scott Mitchell's article](http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/042104-1.aspx) on 4GuysFromRolla. I started with his code and tweaked it. Along the way I learned a bit more about how .TEXT is held together.

Assuming I don't get crushed by "ratings spam", I'll probably add a list on the side at some point that shows the highest rated posts. We'll see.

UPDATE: I guess I should have kept reading. Scott already wrote [an article that shows the stored proc and the user control](http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/043004-1.aspx) to show the top 5 rated articles. I'll add that later.

UPDATE (2): I have pulled the rating system for now. I didn't test it thoroughly enough and [Darrel Norton](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/) was kind enough to point out an error. I'll try to fix it tonight and turn it back on.
