Well that didn't take long. Yesterday I received three and then today got seven more. And all of them are cool in one way or another. Thanks so much to everyone who participated.

Unfortunately, I only have six invites to give away, so I had two choices: the first six recieved, or the best six (as judged by me). 

To be fair, I decided to go with first six. Sorry to those of you who were too late. When/if I get more invites, we will play again. Stay tuned.

Here are the six winners in the order they were received. (If you see your name here, you should get your GMail invite shortly.)

1. Jeremiah Johnson:

Thanks again to everyone who submitted.
