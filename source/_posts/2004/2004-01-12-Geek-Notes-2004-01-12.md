Another day another dollar. I finally found that damn COM leak that was bugging me last week. I didn't commit to my SCM system often enough however and had to go back to a previous version and work forwarrd. Ugh. Had the pleasure of re-doing about 1 1/2 hours of work. Damn I hate it when I do that.
