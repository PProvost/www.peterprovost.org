Instead of German mafia (which isn't fair because they aren't all German), I think maybe we should call them

> **The Secret AGENT Cartel**

Where AGENT is **A**ustro-**G**erman-**E**uropean .**N**et **T**echnology

What do you think? ThinkTechture is just too hard to say. Secret AGENT Cartel is much better. :)
