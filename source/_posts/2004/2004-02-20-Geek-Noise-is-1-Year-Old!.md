Today is the first anniversary of Geek Noise. I know that sometimes it has been good and other times it has been bad, but it has certainly been a fun year for me. Hopefully you, my 7 readers, have enjoyed it as well. :) 

Back on February 20, 2003 [I started using Radio as my weblog engine](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/default.aspx?date=2003-02-20). I had done something like blogging for years, but it hadn't been a "real" blog. I ended up using Radio for almost 6 months before finally getting frustrated enough with it to find something new. I had been looking at BlogX for a while, but hadn't really been impressed. Then in June of 2003 Clemens started talking about his rewite to be called dasBlog. I downloded the first version in July of 2003 and [made the switch](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b1033dec-5aa6-4925-81e0-c60e6190e648) on July 31. 

At the end of October was the PDC and [I blogged it hard](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/default.aspx?date=2003-10-26). And I also got more traffic that week than ever before (or after). It was a hell of a lot of fun and I met some good friends there. 

On [November 7, 2003 I started penning](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c18b734e-d027-428f-bb31-194104037528) the (almost) daily Geek Notes. I decided to emulate the style of a few other bloggers and produce one post of links a day instead of many small posts throughout the day. I still made other posts when the topic warranted it, but for "cool links" I would only be using Geek Notes. I think it has been a success. What do you think? On November 30 I introduced [my Longhorn theme for dasBlog](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=123eaf14-482a-49cc-bb78-8d26363d2c5b). 

For most of 2004, I've been keeping up with the Geek Notes. There have been occasional outages, but in general I've stuck to the one-a-day format. As the year has progressed however, I've been finding myself more and more frustrated with dasBlogs lack of an articles feature. 

Two days ago I finally got the Interlink Weblogs setup and found myself really impressed with .TEXT. It has articles, galleries, and all kinds of other features that I've missed. So don't be too surprised if I switch again soon. Has anyone done a dasBlog to .TEXT switch? Any pointers or tools? 

Thanks to all of you for reading me this past year and I hope you keep coming back this year.
