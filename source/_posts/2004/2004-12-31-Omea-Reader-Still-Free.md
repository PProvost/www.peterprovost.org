The nice folks at [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/index.html) have decided to extend the free license period for Omea Reader, their excellent RSS and USENET reader, until March 31, 2005.

Even if you don't [download it](http://www.jetbrains.com/omea_reader/download) now, you should at lease go [get a free license key](http://www.jetbrains.com/forms/omea_reader/download/license) while they're&nbsp_place_holder;available.
