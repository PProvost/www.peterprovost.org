Recently I got the Dell [D/View Notebook Stand](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx?sku=310-2881&c=us&l=en&cs=04&category_id=5441&first=true&page=productlisting.aspx) and [D/Port Advanced Port Replicator](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx?sku=310-2874&spagenum=&category_id=5441&brandid=&k=&c=us&l=en&cs=04&mnf=&prst=&prEnd=&mnfsku=&orderby=&searchtype=&pageb4search=&page=productlisting.aspx&instock=&refurbished=) for my desk at work. I love it. I considered getting a [Sherpaq Oyster](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008BQVP/peterprovosto-20), but there were a few things that made the Dell version stand out. The D/View gets my screen up nice and high, just like with the Oyster, but the D/Port gets me DVI, Ethernet, video, another power adapter and more. Recommended.

  * ["Killer Examples" for Design Patterns and Objects](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~alphonce/KillerExamples/) - How have I not run across this before. It'll take a few days to get through, but it sure looks interesting.
  * [Celestia Astronomy Simulator](http://www.shatters.net/celestia/index.html)&nbsp_place_holder;- WOW! This is the coolest astronomy program I've ever seen. I ran across it in the [November 2004 issue of Discover Magazine](http://www.discover.com/issues/nov-04). You can fly anywhere you want (literally) at any time you want (literally). The coolest part is that you can download add-ons&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;for things that don't even exist or scripts for tours and demos from [The Celestia Motherlode](http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/).
  * [Abstract Test Classes in VSTS 2005](http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx?blog=entry.20041027T010719) - Jason Bock has discovered a nastly little flaw in the test-runner implementation in Visual Studio Team System. I sure hope they get it fixed before ship time. Effectively [refactoring your test code](http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx?blog=entry.20040726T125410) is just as important as refactoring your production code.
  * [Legal Concerns Over MSN Spaces Clarified](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/07/xeni_on_npr_msn_spac.html) - BoingBoing reader Joshua Wattles, who also happens to be an entertainment law attorney in Los Angeles, counters [concerns that MS is trying to steal blogger's copyright](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/02/msn_spaces_soylent_g.html).
  * [Effective XML Schema Design](http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/archive/2004/12/07/278199.aspx) - Christian Weyer says we should all read this again and again

UPDATE 2004-12-21: [Brian Button](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/oneagilecoder/) pointed out to me that the link for "Abstract Test Classes in VSTS 2005" was broken. Thanks, it has been fixed.
