It took too long (flew through Phoenix) but I'm finally here at [Win-Dev](http://butrain.bu.edu/windev/default.asp) in Boston.

I landed just as the 6th inning was finishing and got to the hotel just in time to have a couple of Guinness while watching the last two innings. Congrats to the Bo-Sox, but I know [Brian](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/oneagilecoder/) and [Jim](http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk) are very disappointed. Haven't seen anyone I know yet, but I'm sure I will. ([Keith](http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/default.aspx) is here somewhere.)&nbsp_place_holder;If you see me, please grab me and say hi.

Tomorrow (Thursday) I give my first talk during the last [C#/CLR track](http://butrain.bu.edu/windev/track2.asp): Refactoring Support in the Whidbey IDE. Friday I do Effective Unit Testing with NUnit in the same timeslot. That is the last session of the track, so hopefully there will still be a few people around to participate.

I'm really looking forward to this as it is my first "real" conference speaking gig. I've spoken a fair amount at local events in Colorado ([MS DevDays](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/devdays/) and others), but this is the first time I've ever been paid as a speaker!! Gotta love that. Many thanks to [Keith Brown](http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/default.aspx) and [Mike Woodring](http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/mike/default.aspx) for getting me involved.
