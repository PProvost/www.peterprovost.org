One more week. That's right. One more week here at Interlink. Then we fly to Seattle for a week of house hunting before I start my new job on Aug 30.

I'm firmly convinced that I have forgotten to do something important... I hate that.

  * [Amazon.com Contrarian Game](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/07/01/amazonco.shtml) - This was hiding in my Inbox on GMail. My good friend [AaronX](http://www.mikulich.com/aaron/default.htm) sent it to me. Good for a laugh!
  * [BizTalk Server 2004 File Dump Utility](http://geekswithblogs.net/cyoung/articles/4867.aspx) - Wow. I wish I'd thought of this. It dumps the C# source code that is generated for a BizTalk Assembly during compilation. Very cool. Now I know how I'll be spending the rest of my day.
  * [Don't Use BizTalk Mapper](http://geekswithblogs.net/cyoung/archive/2004/08/02/9177.aspx) - Strange... I had just come to this conclusion myself. Call me a freak but I prefer good ol' XSLT code. At least in there I know what's gonna happen.
  * [Disable Windows Messenger in XP](http://www.mvps.org/marksxp/WindowsXP/messenger/messenger2.php)&nbsp_place_holder;- I can't remember if I've posted this before, but if you run an alternate IM client like Trillian, you may want to do this. I accidentally launched Outlook Express and Windows Messenger re-enabled itself. I'll also add to the list of things to do, in Outlook 2003, go to Tools | Options | Other and uncheck "Enable the Person Names Smart Tag".
  * [C# 2.0 Specification](http://www.ferca.com/c_2.0_specification.html) - I think I saw a different form of this go by a while ago... can't remember. [via [Wes](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2004/08/language_specif.html)]
  * [Open Intellectual Property](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpenIntellectualProperty.html) - I've always thought that consulting firms really don't have any IP per se that they should be protecting and should therefore participate aggresively in the open-source community. Thoughtworks has always been that way with projects like [CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/)&nbsp_place_holder;and [CruiseControl.NET](http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/).
  * [Essential XML Quick Reference](http://www.theserverside.net/books/addisonwesley/EssentialXML/index.tss) - I know I posted this before, but since I couldn't find it I'll post it again. If you work with XML, you should have [the book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201709147/peterprovosto-20) on your shelf, and this PDF on your desktop.
