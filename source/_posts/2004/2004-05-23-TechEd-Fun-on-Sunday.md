My wife came along with me on this trip. We have a two year old at home and are expecting another in July, so I told her to come with me as a break before we head into life with two children.

She came with me to the registration this afternoon and said some of the funniest things I've ever heard at a tech conference...

> "If I were single, I could get some serious ass here."

That one really broke me up. Then later she said this...

> "Make over shows could kill it here."

Man, that is some funny shit.

Since I'm here on Microsoft's dime this time (working the Arch cabana), I had to attend a "staff training" meeting. Generally good stuff, but also pretty straightforward communication and sales stuff. Not all that exciting.

On my way in I ran into [Rory Blyth](http://neopoleon.com/blog/) and [Carl Franklin](http://weblogs.asp.net/cfranklin/) from [.NET Rocks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/dotnetrocks/). While I was chatting with them, [Harry Pierson](http://devhawk.net/) and [Sandy Khaund](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandyk/) showed up. It was good to see all of them.

Earlier today someone asked me. "Are you going to Rory's Non-Influencer Party tonight?" They were talking about the [Coding Slave get together](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/6252.aspx), but I thought the name was funny. When I told Rory about he laughed too.

Tonight looks like it will be the busiest night of the trip. I am planning to attend the [Architects Road Rally](http://www.dynamicevents.com/ArchitectRoadRally.asp), the Unit Testing BoF and the Code Generation BoF. It will be fun to try to get all of that done at the same time.

Gotta go...
