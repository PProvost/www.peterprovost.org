Tonight I gave a guest lecture at [UCCS](http://www.uccs.edu/) (University of Colorado at Colorado Springs) with [David Yack](http://weblogs.asp.net/mrdave/) (of the [Southern Colorado .NET User's Group](http://www.southcolorado.net/)). It was a fun little chat about .NET and Java. They basically only teach Java at UCCS and one of the teachers was interested in exposing them to a) an alternative technology and b) some professional developers. All in all they were a bright if quiet bunch. Apparently all college students want to be game programmers, and we had to let them down nicely. :)

  * [Cleaner, more elegant and wrong](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/22/118161.aspx) - Raymond Chen gives us a rant about exceptions and exceptional cases. The a number of people add their comments. All good stuff. 
  * [Visual Studio 2005 Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/) - Yeah yeah, I know I'm late to this party, but I couldn't ignore it. 
  * [Wacky Warning Labels](http://www.mlaw.org/wwl/index.html) - The Michigan Lawsuit Abuse Watch (huh?) has published their 7th annual Wacky Warning Label Contest winners. This years winner was the warning on a bottle of drain cleaner that says: "If you do not understand, or cannot read, all directions, cautions and warnings, do not use this product." [via [This is Broken](http://broken.typepad.com/b/2004/04/wacky_warning_l.html)] 
  * [The Open Source Vulnerability Database](http://www.osvdb.org/) - Not open source software, but an open source database... like we needed another BugTraq. It does have an [RSS feed](http://www.osvdb.org/backend/rss.php) though. And if you're interested in digging through the database, it&nbsp_place_holder;has an [XML-RPC API](http://www.osvdb.org/xmlrpc-server-client-documentation.php). Interesting. Maybe I'll write a little app to keep track of Microsoft vs. Non-Microsoft items. [via [TheServerSide.net](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=25201)] 
  * [Beware GoogleBot](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/PermaLink.aspx?guid=54fd1ed8-ea12-4555-9ee3-4f9e3d57907e) - Craig Andera tells an interesting story about what spiders and bots can do if you have a link that performs a destructive action. If you write web apps, you need to read this.
