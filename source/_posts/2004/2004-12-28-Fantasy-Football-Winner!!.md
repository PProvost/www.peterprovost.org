![Fantasy Football Final Results](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/Fantasy_20Football_20Final_20Results.png)I've never really played Fantasy Football before, and honestly, I'm not much of a football fan. Don't get me wrong, I like NFL Football in the same way that I like PGA Golf... I love going to games... if I'm with friends, it is fun to watch over a few beers... etc.

Needless to say, it came as quite a surprise to me (and to my friends back in Denver who are football fans) when I started out the season 7-0. I got lucky and picked up Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss&nbsp_place_holder;_and_ Nate Burleson and they all started out amazingly.

In the middle of the season Randy got hurt and I lost a few games, but by the end of the season I was in the playoffs with a second place overall finish. We had a small league, so playoffs were only two rounds and I dominated both of them... thanks again to the Minnesota Vikings Air Force.

A number of people have suggested to me that I had an advantage by being a complete football outsider who was playing purely from a statistical stance. A bunch of the guys in the league were Denver Broncos fans and aggressively drafted Broncos players. Which is why nobody noticed me picking up the offense that I did (I also got Tiki Barber).

I don't know about that, I just know that I had fun. I hope we have a league next year too, but maybe this time it should be a money league instead of a free one. ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile3.gif)
