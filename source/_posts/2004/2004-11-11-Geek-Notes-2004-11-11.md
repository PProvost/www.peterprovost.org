Today Emily and I celebrate our fourth anniversary as married folks. The last four years have been the best times of my life and I owe it all to Emily for making me this happy. She is my love, my life and the best friend I have in the world. Thanks for everything Em, I love you.

In that demo, they showed a cool piece of Tablet software that let you draw a phyical setup (e.g. a lever or something) and then "run" it. Now you can have it on your tablet! Tres cool. Now I wish I had a Tablet for myself.
  * [The Meaning of "Do Not" and "Never"](http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/weblog/archives/001416.html) - Ingo gives a nice explaination of what geeks really mean when they say that.
  * [Diff/Merge/Patch Library for C#/.NET](http://taubz.for.net/code/diff/) - Joshua Tauberer has ported the Perl module Algorithm::Diff into C#. [via [The Daily Grind 497](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind497.html)]
  * [Leading By Fear](http://www.toolshed.com/blog/SocialCommentary/Goering.html,v) - Given the way we have been spoken to by the goverment in the last couple of years, this is an interesting read.
