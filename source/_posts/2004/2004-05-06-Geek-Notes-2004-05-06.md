This morning the landscapers started working in our yard. This looks like it will be another terrible drought year, but I would rather have a sprinkler system in a drought than not have one. At least this way, when the city says "15 minutes per zone twice a week," I can actually ensure that I'm getting the right amount of water on my lawn. (We are taking pictures of the before, during and after... I'll post them later.)

  * [Service-Oriented Architecture: Considerations for Agile Systems](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/journal/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/aj2service.asp) -
  * [FastObject.NET](http://www.versant.net/eu_en/solutions/dotNet_en) - Versant Software has released FastObject.NET class persistence framework capable to store your objects into a native object oriented database. Using metadata tags you can add persistent attributes to make object persistent capable. [via [TheServerSide.net](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=25578)]
  * [Property or Backing Store from Inside a Class](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericgu/archive/2004/04/29/123243.aspx) - Eric Gunnerson raises the every popular argument of whether a class should talk through its own public interface or if it should be allowed to take advantage of access to internal details. My opinion? It depends... :)
  * [OO in One Sentence](http://www.toolshed.com/blog/SoftwareDevelopment/DryShyGuy.html,v) - The Pragmatic Programmers have written a quick little article about what a good OO program should and shoudn't do.
  * [Custom Caching in ASP.NET](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/archive/2004/05/04/12724.aspx) - Darrell Norton shares his notes from the Devscovery session.
  * [Comment Rot](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/05/04/125893.aspx) - This is a common argument that I seem to have all the time. Comments should explain WHY you did something, not WHAT it does. If you need a WHAT comment, then the code isn't clear enough.
