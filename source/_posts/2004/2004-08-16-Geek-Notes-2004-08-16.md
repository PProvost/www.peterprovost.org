I am really ready to leave now. The manual labor of getting the house ready to go is killing me. Combine that with a newborn and a 2-1/2 year old who gets up twice a night, and I'm done for.

This weekend was very productive for me though. I got the drywall finished, the electrical, some finish work, moved some internet sites, and went to a kick ass going-away party thrown by our good friend Emily Vanderhule. The party was&nbsp_place_holder;a blast, but it sure made Sunday morning's construction efforts a little bit tough. ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Images/Uploads/smile1.gif)

  * [NMap Broken in SP2](http://silverstr.ufies.org/blog/archives/000666.html) - At least it was until Dana Epp got involved and posted [this](http://silverstr.ufies.org/blog/archives/000667.html), [this](http://silverstr.ufies.org/blog/archives/000668.html) and [this](http://silverstr.ufies.org/blog/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=669).
  * [Attaching a Debugger on Startup](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vsdebug/html/vxtskLaunchingDebuggerAutomatically.asp) - Man this is cool a cool registry tweak. A long time ago I was debugging a service and could've used this. [via [Jamie Cansdale](http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2004/08/12/213628.aspx)]
  * [The Zen of .NET](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e26869f0-6d86-4608-ad8b-cdf4b8e2f7ff) -&nbsp_place_holder;A series of Zen Koans by Scott Hansleman to enlighten your day.
  * [NHibernate](http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=NHibernate) - Justin Ghetland writes about this promising port of Hibernate, the popular object/relational mapping tool, from Java to .NET. I've gotta take a look at this one. [via [TSS News](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=28038)]
  * [Testing Resource Pools](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestingResourcePools.html) - Martin Fowler reminds us that when we are testing resource pools containing things like threads or database connections, set the pool size to one for testing.
  * [Conditional Methods](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericgu/archive/2004/08/13/214175.aspx) - I remember when I first discovered this little attribute. No more #if statments! A for a new twist, check out Eric's post on&nbsp_place_holder;[Conditional Attributes](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericgu/archive/2004/08/13/214177.aspx) in Whidbey. Nice.

[UPDATE: I had originally stated that Justin Ghetland was responsible for the NHibernate port, but I was incorrect. Thanks to [Szoke](http://szokelizer.freeblog.hu/) for correcting me.]
