So I'm still out at a local school district doing SharePoint stuff. Having fun and doing some very interesting stuff that I'll be writing about soon. It is way too much for a bog post though, so I'm writing an article. Soon... 

  * [Cargo Cult Programming](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/01/82168.aspx) - I remember running across Richard Feynman's Cargo Cult Science speech a few years ago and thinking that it was a cool story. Now Eric Lippert has applied the story to less-than top-notch developers. (More [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/02/82763.aspx) and [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/02/82840.aspx). And as a side note, in that last link Eric explains Mort, Elvis and Einstein.) [via [simplegeek](http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/dd514da7-8820-4bce-ae11-941a86039ee6)]
  * [Pretty RSS Feeds](http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=3f84a3b5-1541-44b9-a493-daae02c1f94f) - This is nice. All the blog engines should start adding this XSLT sheet to their RSS feeds. He even shows the modified dasBlog source to make it happen (but I haven't done that yet). [via [The Daily Grind 333](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind333.html)]
  * [Using the C# "using" keyword for other purposes](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/03/28/100872.aspx) - Apparently they called it "using" for this very reason!
  * [Balancing Quality with Everything Else](http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20040328.html) - A funny Dilber from this past weekend.
  * [Visual Studio 2005](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040325aspnetsg/manifest.xml) - This was the first official MS text I've seen that says, VS.NET 2005 was formerly referred to as "Whidbey".
  * [MetaBuilders is Going Public!](http://weblogs.asp.net/asmith/archive/2004/03/29/101390.aspx) - OK. Not really. But Andy Smith, owner of the excellent [MetaBuilders](http://www.metabuilders.com/) website has decided to throw out his shingle. Good luck Andy!
