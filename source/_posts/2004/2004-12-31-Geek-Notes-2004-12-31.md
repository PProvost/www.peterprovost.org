The last Geek Notes of 2004...

Scott Watermasysk pointed out via email that├é a couple of days ago I made my 1000th blog post. Wow. I guess this experiment is holding together (assuming there is someone out there reading these words.)

  * [Microsoft Anti-Spyware](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/ms_antispyware_preview.asp) - Somehow I missed the acquisition of Giant Software AntiSpyware by MS. Although I'm a longtime fan of Spybot Search And Destroy, Paul gives it a good review, so I probably need to take a look at this one.
  * [Outlook Command Line Arguments](http://www.outlook-tips.net/howto/commandlines.htm) - As a keyboard junkie, I like to use hotkeys to launch my apps, I knew their was a switch for Outlook to tell it not to create a new window every time, but I couldn't remember what it was. (For the record, it is /recycle.) This site has most/all of them.
  * [Don Box on Presenting](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=31792) - If you've been to any Microsoft-developer conferences in the past 10 years, you've probable seen Don speak. In this Channel 9 video he talks about the goals of presenting and provides a number of dos and don'ts. Don is an experienced educator so whether you like him or not, if you do presentations you need to watch this.

  * [Re-introduction to FIT](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=67373) - "Have you heard about FIT yet? Even if you have, do you know what makes it signficantly different from other testing frameworks? Here is a re-introduction to FIT that highlights one of its most important features."
  * [Adding Support to VS for Your Language](http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2004/12/15/316617.aspx) - Cyrus is thinking about posting a series of articles explaining how to master this mystical art. [via [Eric Gunnerson](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/12/16/318020.aspx)]
  * [US Will Shut Down GPS to Fight Terrorits](http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/ns/news/story.jsp?id=2004121521290001739682&dt=20041215212900&w=APO&coview=) - This is terrifying (sic). "The president also instructed the Defense Department to develop plans to disable, in certain areas, an enemy's access to the U.S. navigational satellites and to similar systems operated by others." [via [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/16/us_will_shut_down_gp.html)]
  * [Programming Fonts](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000157.html) - In this post Jeff Atwood shows screenshots of a number of monospaced fonts. After reading this I switched to [Proggy](http://www.proggyfonts.com/index.php?menu=download). Thanks Jeff.

See you all next year!
