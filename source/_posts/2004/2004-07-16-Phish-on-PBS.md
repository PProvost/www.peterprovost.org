I don't write about&nbsp_place_holder;music much, other than an occasional "Now Playing" link on my posts.

But I spent years of my younger life as a hardcore dedicated fan of Phish. Those wacky psychadelic, jam rock boys from Vermont.

I didn't even post when they announced [the long forseen breakup](http://launch.yahoo.com/read/news.asp?contentID=218291) back in May.

But, since they aren't coming to Colorado on their current (final) tour, I have to post this:

> Select public television stations nationwide will air "IT" a ninety-minute special on Phish's 2003 festival in Limestone, Maine beginning on Monday, August 2 at 10 PM. Shot in breathtaking high-definition video, the program combines exclusive interviews interwoven with live material. It's unquestionably the best footage ever captured of the band playing live. 
> 
> The program was produced by an award-winning production team, including producer/director Mary Wharton, 2003 Grammy award-winner for her documentary "Legend" on the life of singer Sam Cooke and the editing team of Thom Zimny, who won an Emmy for his work on Bruce Springsteen's "Live in New York City" and editor Alex Hall. Also part of the production team is sound engineer and five-time Grammy Award winner Elliot Scheiner, a pioneer in 5.1 technology, who mixed both the stereo and surround sound versions. 

For a list of stations that will be showing it, visit [this page at phishook.com](http://www.phishhook.com/board/viewtopic.php?p=3644480&highlight=#3644480).

Now... can someone record the hidef audio for me? I don't have a hidef TV, so I don't care about that yet, but I would love the audio on CD or MP3. :)
