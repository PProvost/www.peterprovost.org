It looks like we've found a house here in Washington. It is in Sammamish, so I'm hoping the drive won't be too bad (although apparently the only way to be sure is to drive before 7:30am).

  * [Doom 3 Demo Available](http://www.3dgamers.com/games/doom3/#filelist) - I'm pretty sure my crappy old laptop won't run it, even if I could get it down over dialup, but the screenshots sure are pretty.

  * [Reverse](http://www.scenta.co.uk/reverse/) - This is kind of a game, kind of a puzzle. How well can you do if your mouse movements are all reversed?
