So after much hemming-and-hawing I finally decided to do some pruning on my RSS feed list. I just couldn't keep up. And boy did it make a difference. For the first time in months, I actually got completely caught up in NewsGator. Wow. What a feeling. 

Oh and I want to apologize for my last post where I incorrectly said that it has been eight years since the last leap year. As [Darrell Norton](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/) [pointed out in my comments](/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=43df90f2-cc65-42b3-ae15-0b0390c0d552), if the century is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year. So 1600 was, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years. And then 2000 was a leap year again. Oops. My bad. 

  * [Debug and Retail Builds on the .NET Framework](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/02/29/81870.aspx) - Brad Abrams is looking for some input regarding whether MS should release Debug builds of the framwork. I think I agree with him... the cons outweigh the pros. 
  * [FreeTextBox 2.0](http://www.freetextbox.com/) - The best free Rich Text Box for .NET just went 2.0. New features include cross browser support (WOW!), localization, external javascript, and more. Sweet! [via [Scott Waterwasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2004/03/01/11470.aspx)] 
  * [Defending YAGNI](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/03/02/defending_yagni) - In Extreme Programming, we have a saying that goes "[You Aren't Gonna Need It](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt)" aka YAGNI. Many developers argue that it is wrong, that you really should build in all those things that you _might_ need later. In this excellent post by Charles Miller, he defends why YAGNI is right. Please read this if you have a tendency to put things in "just in case". 
  * [Ebay Auctions and You](http://weblogs.ilg.com/trussell/archive/2004/03/01/237.aspx) - In this excellent post Tim Russel explores the kind of due dilligence you should perform before making a purchase on eBay. Don't assume everyone selling is reputable. 
  * [Microsoft Offline Application Block](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=bd864eb5-56b3-43a5-a964-6f23566df0ab) - I helped review the early documentation for this block and it is a pretty good design. I haven't used it yet, but if you need to support an offline cached model for a Smart Client application, this is a good place to start.
  * WinZip 9.0 Released - Its about time! Finally a zip tool that handles really big files (like 5GB VPC files).
