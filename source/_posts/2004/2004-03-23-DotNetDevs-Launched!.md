Brad Wilson (aka The .NET Guy) just launched a new site consisting of nothing but high quality articles about .NET development at [www.dotnetdevs.com](http://www.dotnetdevs.com). 

It currently contains five article written by Brad about a number of interesting topics, but I know Brad is looking to get other writers involved. 

My favorite article is [Attribute Based URL Dispatching](http://www.dotnetdevs.com/articles/AttributeBasedURLDispatch.aspx) where Brad describes his technique for using .NET Attributes and Reflection to dynamically create URL endpoints when using HTTP Handlers. Very cool stuff. 

Keep an eye on this site. If nothing else, you should subscribe to the RSS Feed [[headlines](http://www.dotnetdevs.com/rss/headlines.xml) | [full content](http://www.dotnetdevs.com/rss/fullcontent.xml)].
