I still can't get BlogJet to connect to my weblog from campus. It is very strange...&nbsp_place_holder;[Brian Button](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/oneagilecoder/)&nbsp_place_holder;(who is a contractor using his own computer) can use it from his machine, but I can't.

As an experiment today I installed [Sysinternals'](http://www.sysinternals.com/) [TDImon](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/tdimon.shtml) to see what was going on and as far as I can tell, BlogJet is completely unable to establish a connection to my blog.

But, as I said in a previous post, I can type the URL for the Metaweblog API endpoint into a browser and see the ASP.NET generated web service test form. So I know I can get there, I just can't get there with BlogJet.

I also tried connecting from one of my Windows Server 2003 VPC sessions, just in case it is related to Windows XP SP2, which I have installed on my work machine. No joy.

I also reinstalled the ISA Firewall Client, just in case. Still nothing.

I've tried contacting BlogJet for support and received no real help, which is also very disappointing given that I have actually paid for this software.

Can anyone recommend any other tools for troubleshooting this kind of thing?
