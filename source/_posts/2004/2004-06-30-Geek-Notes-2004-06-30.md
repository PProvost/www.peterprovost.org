Still working on BizTalk. I spent today refreshing my mind by reviewing the [BTS04 Tutotial](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9c64562c-3fa7-49ba-885e-82213d00776e&displaylang=en) and [Updated Product Documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/def/htm/ebiz_def_portal_page.asp) (it has been a while since I worked with it).

I also started collecting information from [Covast](http://www.covast.com/) about their [EDI Accelerator](http://www.covast.com/products/accelerator__2004.asp). Looks sweet.

  * [BizTalk Core Engine's WebLog](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_core_engine/) - Looks like some of the BTS Team has [started](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_core_engine/archive/2004/06/30/169430.aspx) a [group](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_core_engine/archive/2004/06/28/168259.aspx) [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_core_engine/archive/2004/06/27/167451.aspx). I wonder if they've heard my cry for a unit testing solution? Sure would be nice to see a post from them on that front. 
  * [CDex](http://www.cdex.n3.net/) - I have been using Windows Media Player for a while, but I recently went back to WinAMP. So I needed a good way to rip my CDs. I used to use EAC+LAME, but Brad Wilson showed me this free tool which works like a charm. 
  * [Unit Testing With a Database](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/06/21/161540.aspx) - Jim Newkirk posts a couple of articles about the problems of database testing. I would also recommend Jim's book as a reference on that topic. 
  * [To Throw or Not To Throw](http://weblogs.ilg.com/KSyverstad/archive/2004/06/21/399.aspx) - That is the question. 
  * [Interactive Source Code](http://aisto.com/roeder/Paper/InteractiveSourceCode.ppt) - Lutz Roeder wrote this Powerpoint deck a few years ago about source code, IDEs, Reflector and other fun stuff. [via [Sam Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/06/22/12023.aspx)] 
  * [Property Grid in Reflector](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/06/22/531.aspx) - I don't know how Peli has time to write all of these. I thought [he was going to work for MS soon](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/05/28/265.aspx)! 
  * [NAnt and Multiple .NET Versions](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b8619b30-dc90-4e5e-959f-91c54147540a) - Scott Hanselman shows us how to make sure NAnt runs with the version you expect. 
  * [Using Test Data Files in NUnit](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a8bbf0a5-188e-429f-8e37-a8813b460780) - I always thought everyone did this, but apparently they don't. They should. 
  * [Cleansweep](http://betterme.org/cleansweep.html) - I don't think I can do this. In fact even looking at their list of "100 things you should do to make your life better" makes me unhappy. Perhaps #1 on the list should be "stop reading this list". [via [SecretGeek](http://www.secretGeek.net/mmms.asp)]
