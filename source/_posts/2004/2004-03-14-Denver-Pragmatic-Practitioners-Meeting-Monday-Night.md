**Topic:** Security 

├é 

Security is an important topic for software developers. In this connected world, it's not practical to be ignorant of the security implications of your software architecture. Even such things as which tools you choose may dictate a need for specific security practices during the development phase. 

├é 

Come out and chat with us about what it means to be a security conscious developer. 

├é 

Refreshments will be provided. 

├é 

We look forward to seeing you there.
