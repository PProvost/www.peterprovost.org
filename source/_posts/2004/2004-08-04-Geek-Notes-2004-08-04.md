The basement is coming along nicely at this point. I've got the walls framed, the electrical all in and about 20% of the drywall up. I'm going to try to do the rest of the walls this week and then this weekend I'll rent a [panel lifter](http://www.fantastictools.com/pages/telpro_drywall_lifter.htm#telpro%20panel_lift) and do the ceiling.

  * [Active Object Pattern in .NET](http://oneagilecoder.blogspot.com/2004/07/present-i-promised.html) - Brian Button shows a very nice little implementation of the [Active Object Pattern](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Act-Obj.pdf) that lets you decouple method execution from method invocation when working with background processing scenarios. If you aren't familiar with this pattern, you should take a look at Brian's post and the PDF.
  * [Woot There It Is!](http://www.woot.com/) - Will [posted this](http://iamwill.com/admin/wp/index.php?p=210) on his blog... they sell one product a day at a price you can't believe. Check it out.
  * [Pub/Sub Systems In BizTalk 2004](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_core_engine/archive/2004/07/22/191888.aspx) - The BizTalk Core Engine team has posted a nice write up of how pub/sub works inside of BizTalk 2004.

By the way, come back later today because I'll be making a big&nbsp_place_holder;announcement (for me). I decided against the whole, "7 days until something big happens" pioneered by the Thinktechture guys, but I don't mind giving a few hours foreshadowing. :)
