For a while now there has been a community groundswell of people asking for a sactioned implementation of XPathReader. Both [DonXML](http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2004/02/26/430.aspx) and [Mark Fussell](http://blogs.msdn.com/mfussell/archive/2004/02/27/80963.aspx) have posted about it. (And asked for a petition to get it implemented.)

Well, I just saw this come through my [MSDN Downloads feed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/rss.asp), so I'm guessing their petition idea worked.
