The NUnit team has [released the first beta](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=377077) of the fourth major release of NUnit. I've been playing around with the source tip of this version for a couple of weeks and it is cool:

  * Assert.AreEqual now supports comparing arrays
  * CategoryAttribute allows you to group tests into logical categories like "FastTests" or "SlowTests"
  * ExplicitAttribute allows you to say that a test should only be run when explicitly indicated by the user
  * NUnit GUI now has checkboxes so you can select specific tests to run
  * Comes with a built-in, lightweight Mock Object facility
  * Mono support

You can [download the beta here](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10749&package_id=89482).
