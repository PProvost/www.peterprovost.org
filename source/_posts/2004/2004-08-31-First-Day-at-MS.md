I'm sure you all read Rory's post about [his NEO experience](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7523.aspx). Mine was similar but different.&nbsp_place_holder;A lot of information... more than any one human can expect to take at one time.

After that I headed over to meet with my new boss, [Jim Newkirk](http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/). We got me settled into my office (5/2191), chatted a bit and made sure my logins worked and such. A little bit later [Ward Cunningham](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham) swung by to say hi (his office is two doors down from mine). Slowly, over the next hour or two, I met many more people on the team, including most of the people on the EntLib team.

I'm still waiting for my "real" machine to arrive, so I'm using a temp laptop for now. I hope they let me keep it, but I've been told that SDEs don't get laptops. Bummer.
