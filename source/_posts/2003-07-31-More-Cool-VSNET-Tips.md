Wow. There are some very cool tips here.

  * _Command Line (CTRL+/)_  
I was already a big fan of the Command Window (CTRL+ALT+A) as a way of driving the UI, but honestly the keystroke sucks. Of course I could change it, but I try to avoid that in case I'm helping someone on their machine and they don't have my keymappings. Command Line does what you want 90% of the time and is a lot faster to get to. 
  * _Incremental Search (CTRL+I)_  
I found this once before and loved it. Then I forgot about it again. Maybe I'll actually use it this time.

That's enough for now... there are too many to comment on them all.
