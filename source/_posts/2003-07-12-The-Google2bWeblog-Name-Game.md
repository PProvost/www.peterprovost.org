> I was shocked yesterday to find out that on a [google search for "Luke"](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=luke), my weblog comes up as #5, beating Skywalker, Perry, the Apostle, Duke and Cool Hand. My first reaction was that someone at Google must have screwed something up, but then it dawned on me that the reason for this is that webloggers are not only link-crazy, they also typically link on a first-name-only basis, which Google obviously picks up on.

I guess I'm not that popular... I came in at 158 on "Peter".&nbsp_place_holder; I'm #3 on Provost though, but that isn't such a popular name, so I shouldn't be surprised.
