Now that I have solved the BlogJet problem, I can easily post Geek Notes again. Yay!

  * [Bookmark Collection User Stories](http://weblogs.asp.net/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/09/07/226553.aspx) - Jim has started posting the test list for his new TDD demo... a Bookmark Collection.
  * [Usability Tricks](http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2004/09/07#usability-tricks) - This is an excellent list of things developers can do to improve the usability of their user interfaces. Best quote: "Using five colors haphazardly makes you screen look like salad."
  * [Longhorn Transformation Pack 7](http://www.tcmagazine.info/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7077) - Makes Windows XP (or Server 2003) look like various Longhorn builds. I don't know if I would put this on my day-to-day computer, but I may install it into a VPC just to take a look. [via [The Daily Grind 457](http://www.larkware.com/Articles/TheDailyGrind457.html)]
  * [MS Fingerprint Keyboard](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+under+your+thumb/2100-1041_3-5349583.html?part=rss&tag=5349583&subj=news.1041.20) - I have a cool little USB Fingerprint scanner that is nice (especially when you are where they have a nasty password policy), but having it built into the keyboard would be even nicer!

  * [It Costs More To Get Less](http://broken.typepad.com/b/2004/09/dell_ordering.html) - I can't believe this is Dell Mark Hurst is talking about. I've never had an experience like that, but I think that if I did, like him, I would buy something else... but for me it wouldn't be an Apple.
  * [Command Line to Clipboard](http://neocranium.com/jasonw/archive/2004/09/09/208.aspx) - Why oh why didn't someone think of this sooner? The fact that it takes just one line of C# code to do it is even more annoying. [via [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=66adaf24-d632-4885-9546-ee95e7b4729d)]
