From [Scott Hanselman's Weblog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/):

> _This just in.&nbsp_place_holder; Today the _[**_Doculabs_**](http://www.doculabs.com/Downloads/WebServicePerformance_04-03.pdf)_ "@Bench" Web Services Benchmark came out.&nbsp_place_holder; Here's a snippet from the Table of Contents to give you an idea of the scenarios they tried:_
>
>> __Summary Results: Application Server X on Windows 2000 and Oracle9i_  
___Summary Results: Application Server Y on Windows 2000 and Oracle9i  
__Summary Results: JBoss on Red Hat Linux 8.0 and Oracle9i_  
___Summary Results: .NET 1.1 on Windows 2000 and Oracle9i  
__Summary Results: .NET 1.1 on Windows 2003 and Oracle9i_  
_Summary Results: .NET 1.1 on Windows 2003 and SQL Server 2000__
> 
> _The results you ask?&nbsp_place_holder; Let's just summarize by saying:_
> 
>   * _Windows and the .NET Framework is the Best Platform for Web Services_
> 
>   * _JBoss on Linux was the fastest Java system (!)_
> 
>   * _Web Services on J2EE offers inconsistant performance _
>   * _Oracle on Windows 2003 Server is a very viable option_
> 
>   * _Windows 2003 Server and Oracle offered a 37% increase in throughput compared to Windows 2000 and Oracle_
> 
>   * _Windows 2003 Server and SQL2k offered roughtly an 38% increase in throughput compared to Windows 2003 and Oracle_

Yet another piece of ammo in my .NET vs. J2EE arguments...
