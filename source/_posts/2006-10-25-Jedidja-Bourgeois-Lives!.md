My good friend Jedidja (pronounces _zhe-dee-zha_ -&nbsp_place_holder;but we call him&nbsp_place_holder;Casper) from our Ireland sub has finally started blogging. He is an up-and-coming agile evangelist and all-around good guy.

He has just started his blog over on MSDN blogs: [http://blogs.msdn.com/agilemonkey/](http://blogs.msdn.com/agilemonkey/)

His [introductory post](http://blogs.msdn.com/agilemonkey/archive/2006/10/25/analyzethis.aspx) is up and hopefully some interesting content is on the way.
