I ran across a post to the [XP Denver Users Group](http://www.xpdenver.org/) from a guy at [SCM Labs](http://scmlabs.com/). They are claiming to have the perfect product for SCM in an XP/Agile environment.

Here's the thing that confuses me... If Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, etc. could pull off a successful project with index cards and a cork board, why does everyone seem to think that they need a "software tool" to manage their XP processes? If you are doing it right, it just isn't that hard!

About the only software tool that I've found useful for XP projects is a [Wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki). Anything else is just overkill. Remember the XP motto: **Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.**
