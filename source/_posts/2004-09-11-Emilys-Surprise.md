So today I executed a suprise present for my wife Emily. It worked like a charm.

Three weeks ago we moved to Seattle with a 6 week old and a 2-1/2 year old. I would be lying if I said that this had been easy. It hasn't been to bad for me personally, but I get to go to work and hang out with cool people doing what I love. Emily, on the other hand, gets to stay home, in a strange town, with a demanding toddler and a demanding infant.

My dad and his wife came out to help us get settled for the first two weeks, and that helped a lot. It allowed us to get out an explore a bit, see an occasional movie, have a quiet dinner together, etc. But when they left, that all ended. And it didn't take long for Emily to really start feeling homesick.

So I came up with a plan. I emailed her best friend in Denver and proposed a surprise visit. She accepted and this afternoon she arrived.

I'd already made an excuse to get out by myself for a while: "Why don't you take a nap while the kids do and I'm gonna take a break and go down to Fry's to take a look around." And then I headed to the airport.

The pickup went flawlessly, and as I'd hoped, when we got back to the apartment, Emily was asleep. She heard me come in the bedroom and said groggily, "Shhh... the baby just fell asleep, so I haven't had much of a nap."

"OK," I said, "do you want your present now?"

"Yes"

I said, "Should I bring it in here or do you want to come out and see it?" 

"What is it?" she asked.

"Not telling. You want it in here or out there?" I demanded.

"In here," she decided.

So I went back out, pulling the door closed behind me. I told her friend to go down and just walk in and then I followed behind.

Emily sat up in bed and said, "What..? Uh.. Are you really here? ARE YOU REALLY HERE?"

I think she wasn't really awake yet because that continued for 5 minutes or so before she finally accepted what her eyes were telling her. And then, when she had cried a bit and hugged her friend, she said to me, "Thanks honey. This is one of the best gifts I've ever been given."

That is worth any amount of money in the world. As they say in the Visa commercials... PRICELESS!
