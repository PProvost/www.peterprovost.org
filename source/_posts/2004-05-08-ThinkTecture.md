The German Tech Mafia, [Ingo](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/), [Christian](http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/), [Christian](http://weblogs.asp.net/cnagel) have been dropping hints for days about some big announcement involving four of them (who's the fourth? could it be [Clemens](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/)?).

Now it looks like they have a website up called [ThinkTechture](http://www.thinktecture.com/) to hold whatever it is that they are working on. It has an [RSS feed](http://www.thinktecture.com/Weblogs/rss.aspx), so you can subscribe to one common place to see what they're doing.

This better be worth it.

UPDATE: It looks like [the fourth person may be](http://weblogs.asp.net/ralfw/archive/2004/05/06/126979.aspx) Ralf Westphal.
