Thursday last week I went in to get my vasectomy and spent last weekend laying down as much as possible. A number of friends had warned me to be prepared for some serious pain, but honestly it wasn't that bad. The procedure took all of 15 minutes and I was in the car on the way home less than an hour after arriving at the doctor's office.

The doctor used an interesting "no scalpel" technique which the nerd in me had to research. I found [an article at the Texas Medical Center website](http://www.tmc.edu/tmcnews/06_01_03/page_02.html) which explains it pretty well. My dad had the same technique done on him and like me didn't have a lot of pain or issues.

Anyway, instead of spending that time reading and writing blogs, I chose to watch a bunch of movies (the entire [LOTR Extended Edition DVD set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000654ZK0/peterprovosto-20) and [The Incredibles](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JN4W/peterprovosto-20)) and started programming a game in Ruby using [RUDL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rudl).
