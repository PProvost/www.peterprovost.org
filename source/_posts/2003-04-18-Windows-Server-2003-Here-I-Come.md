I finally finished my download of [Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/) and I'm ready to go. I'm going to take a shot at installing it on my laptop this weekend. I sure hope it doesn't give me too much trouble. I'm also hoping I can install things like CS2K2, SPS and BTS2K2 on it. We'll see...
