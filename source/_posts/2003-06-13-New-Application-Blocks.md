You've probably heard me talk about the forthcoming UIP Application Block. You can expect to see a number of new Application Blocks arrive this year, of which UIP, Updater and Configuration have specific interest for me. Three others were released today:

  * [Service Aggregation Block  
](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9058f345-e5fe-42fc-b40b-14ebdd182f48&displaylang=en)The Aggregation Application Block is a .NET Framework extension that allows you to easily manage and coalesce information from various service providers and other systems and present that information to users.

  * [Asynchronous Invocation Application Block  
](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=794ec811-b5ea-46ae-baa4-69a3deadd38e&displaylang=en)The Microsoft Asynchronous Invocation Application Block manages asynchronous communication between a Web client and one or more foreign service providers (FSP).

  * [Caching Application Block  
](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=b55164c9-94c8-4077-aa29-afe4074746de&displaylang=en)The Caching Application Block has been designed to encapsulate Microsoft's recommended best practices for caching in .NET applications

I haven't played with any of these yet, so I can't say good or bad things about them. I've been beta testing the UIP block, though and I'll have a lot more to say about that soon.
