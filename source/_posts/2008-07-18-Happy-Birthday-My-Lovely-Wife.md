[![peter and em in sydney](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/HappyBirthdayMyLovelyWife_8603/peter%20and%20em%20in%20sydney_thumb.jpg)](/images/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/HappyBirthdayMyLovelyWife_8603/peter%20and%20em%20in%20sydney_2.jpg) Today is Emily's 35th birthday. She is the light of my life. Elegant, smart, funny, witty and fun to be with. A great mom, wife, sister and daughter. She makes everyone around her laugh and have fun.

I can't imagine life without you Em.

Happy Birthday!

Update: Emily made me change the pic to one she likes better. LOL. This is us in Sydney in 2006.
