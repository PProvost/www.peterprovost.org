Today is Emily's birthday and [apparently I didn't give her enough information](http://blogs.provost.org/emily/archive/2005/07/18/6056.aspx) early enough in the day for her liking. ![](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/smile1.gif)&nbsp_place_holder;But I think she'll enjoy her present: a trip to KC to see her old college friends _sans children_. I wanted to get her [all the things she's dreaming of](http://blogs.provost.org/emily/archive/2005/07/15/5933.aspx), but this just isn't the year for that. Next yearΓÇª

  * [Assert.IsEqualGraph](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/keith/archive/2005/06/01/9699.aspx) - Keith Brown has blogged a cool little code snippet that lets you compare two entire object graphs from your NUnit tests. With a couple of mods it should work with VS Test too. If only the authors of both frameworks had given us Assert.AreEqual( object a, object b, IComparer comparer ) this kind of thing would be even easer.
  * [Peanut Butter and Wiki](http://pbwiki.com/) - What a great concept. Need a little wiki for your project? Want it to be private and password protected? Visit this site and you can be up and running in 30 seconds. [via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/01/peanut_butter_and_wi.html)]
  * [![Would you buy a camera from this store?](http://www.peterprovost.org/Files/Broadway_Photo.jpg)The Truth Behind Online Camera Dealers](http://www.panix.com/~donwiss/pictures/BrooklynStores/) - HmmmΓÇª Would you buy a camera from the outfit in this picture? Yeah, me neither. Don Wise has taken photos of many of the brick-and-mortar storefronts for dozens of online camera stores. Buyer beware! [via Boing Boing]
  * [iTunes Music Store Weirdness](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2005/07/16/5992.aspx) - Hmmm. I wonder why the iTunes music store would require you to deauthorize your computer before you upgrade your hardware. That is as dumb as Windows making you reauthorize your Windows for the same kind of thing. Dumb dumb dumb. Now if only I could get MSN Music tunes on my iPod, all would be well in the world.
  * [The Joy of Netsh](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2005/06/02/424863.aspx) - I knew there had to be a command line utility for things like the new firewall settings. Michael Howard shows some cool things you can do with this little tool. From looking at the usage output ("netsh /?") there are a lot more things it can do too.
