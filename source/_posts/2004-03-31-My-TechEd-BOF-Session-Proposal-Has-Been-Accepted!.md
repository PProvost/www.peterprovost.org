Today I proposed a Birds of a├é Feather session for TechEd 2004 and it has been accepted for voting. If you think this would make a good BoF session, please go vote. If it happens, I├é plan to├é bring a fully working [CruiseControl.NET](http://www.continuousintegration.net/) virtual machine running [Subversion](http://www.continuousintegration.net/) as the SCM system. :) 

Here is what I submitted: 

> **Continuous Integration in .NET**
> 
> Setting up a continuous integration system for .NET development is a challenging but essential process. In this session, we will discuss the tools that are currently available, see demos of one or two and talk about the state of CI in .NET.
