I know Scott Hanselman keeps his huge list of his favorite tools,
and I don't mean for this to compete with that. Rather, this
is just my list of favorite tools and things, in one place
so I can remember what they are and where to get them.

**Rufus** - <http://rufus.akeo.ie/> - My favorite tool for making
bootable USB sticks out of an installer ISO.

**Greenshot** - <http://getgreenshot.org/> - A kick-ass screenshot
app with editing, multiple targets, app integration, etc.
